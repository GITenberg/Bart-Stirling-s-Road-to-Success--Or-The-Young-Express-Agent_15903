<h3>THE THIRD OF JULY</h3>


<p>"You can't go in that room."</p>

<p>"Why can't I?"</p>

<p>"Because that's the orders; and you can't smoke
in this room."</p>

<p>Bart Stirling spoke in a definite, manly fashion.</p>

<p>Lemuel Wacker dropped his hand from the
door knob on which it rested, and put his pipe in
his pocket, but his shoulders hunched up and his
unpleasant face began to scowl.</p>

<p>"Ho!" he snorted derisively, "official of the
company, eh? Running things, eh?"</p>

<p>"I am&mdash;for the time being," retorted Bart,
cheerfully.</p>

<p>"Well," said Wacker, with an ugly sidelong
look, "I don't take insolence from anyone with the
big head. I reckon ten year's service with the
B. &amp; M. entitles a man to know his rights."</p>

<p>"Very active service just now, Mr. Wacker?"
insinuated Bart pleasantly.</p>

<p>Lem Wacker flushed and winced, for the
pointed question struck home.</p>

<p>"I don't want no mistering!" he growled.
"Lem's good enough for me. And I don't take
no call-down from any stuck-up kid, I want you
to understand that."</p>

<p>"You'd better get to the crossing if you're
making any pretense of real work," suggested Bart
just then.</p>

<p>As he spoke Bart pointed through the open
window across the tracks to the switch shanty at
the side of the street crossing.</p>

<p>A train was coming. Mr. Lemuel Wacker was
"subbing" as extra for the superannuated old
cripple whose sole duty was to wave a flag as
trains went by. To this duty Wacker sprang
with alacrity.</p>

<p>Bart dismissed the man from his mind, and,
whistling a cheery tune, bent over the book in
which he had been writing for the past twenty
minutes.</p>

<p>This was the register of the local express office
of the B. &amp; M., and at present, as Bart had said,
he was "running it."</p>

<p>The express shed was a one-story, substantial
frame building having two rooms. It stood in
the center of a network of tracks close to the
freight depot and switch tower, and a platform ran
its length front and rear.</p>

<p>Framed by the window an active railroad panorama
spread out, and beyond that view the quaint
town of Pleasantville.</p>

<p>Bart had spent all his young life here. He
knew every nook and corner of the place, and
nearly every man, woman and child in the village.</p>

<p>Pleasantville did not belie its name to Bart's
way of thinking. He voted its people, its surroundings,
and life in general there, as pleasant as
could well be.</p>

<p>Here he was born, and he had found nothing
to complain of, although he was what might be
called a poor boy.</p>

<p>There were his mother, his two sisters and two
small brothers at home, and sometimes it took a
good deal to go around, but Bart's father had a
steady job, and Bart himself was an agreeable,
willing boy, just at the threshold of doing something
to earn a living and wide-awake for the earliest
opportunity.</p>

<p>Mr. Stirling had been express agent for the
B. &amp; M. for eight years, and was counted a reliable,
efficient employee of the company.</p>

<p>For some months, however, his health had not
been of the best, and Bart had been glad when
he was impressed into service to relieve his father
when laid up with his occasional foe, the rheumatism,
or to watch the office at mealtimes.</p>

<p>Bart was on duty in this regard at the present
time. It was about five in the afternoon, but it
was also the third of July, and that date, like the
twenty-fourth of December, was the busiest in the
calendar for the little express office.</p>

<p>All the afternoon Bart had worked at the desk
or helped in getting out packages and boxes for
delivery.</p>

<p>A little handcart was among the office equipment,
and very often Bart did light delivering.
On this especial day, however, in addition to the
regular freight, Fourth of July and general picnic
and celebration goods more than trebled the usual
volume, and they had hired a local teamster to
assist them.</p>

<p>With the 4:20 train came a new consignment.
The back room was now nearly full of cases of
fruit, a grand boxed-up display of fireworks for
Colonel Harrington, the village magnate, another
for a local club, some minor boxes for private
family use, and extra orders from the city for the
village storekeepers.</p>

<p>It was an unusual and highly inflammable heap,
and when tired Mr. Sterling went home to snatch
a bite of something to eat, and lazy Lem Wacker
came strolling into the place, pipe in full blast,
Bart had not hesitated to exercise his brief authority.
A spark among that tinder pile would mean
sure and swift destruction. Besides, light-fingered
Lem Wacker was not to be trusted where things
lay around loose.</p>

<p>So Bart had squelched him promptly and properly.
The man for whom "Lem" was good
enough, was in his opinion pretty nearly good for
nothing.</p>

<p>Bart made the last entry in the register with
a satisfied smile and strolled to the door stretching
himself.</p>

<p>"Everything in apple-pie order so far as the
books go," he observed. "I expect it will be
big hustle and bustle for an hour or two in the
morning, though."</p>

<p>Lem Wacker came slouching along. It was
six o'clock, the quitting hour. Lem was always
on time on such occasions. The whistle from
the shops had ceased echoing, and, his dinner
pail on his arm and filling his inevitable pipe, he
paused for a moment.</p>

<p>"Going to shut up shop?" he inquired with
affected carelessness.</p>

<p>"I am going home, if that's what you mean,"
replied Bart&mdash;"as soon as my father comes."</p>

<p>"Not feeling very well lately, eh?" continued
Lem, his eyes roving in a covetous way over the
cozy office and the comfortable railroad armchair
Mr. Stirling used. "No wonder, he takes it too
hard."</p>

<p>"Does he?" retorted Bart.</p>

<p>"You bet he does. Wish I had his job. I'd
make people wait to suit my ideas. How's the
company to know or care if you break your neck
to accommodate people? Too honest, too."</p>

<p>"A man can't be too honest," asserted Bart.</p>

<p>"Can't he? Say, I'm an old railroader, I am,
and I know the ropes. Why, when I was running
the express office at Corydon, we sampled
everything that came in. Crate of bananas&mdash;we
had many a lunch, apples, cigars, once in a while
a live chicken, and always a couple of turkeys at
holiday time."</p>

<p>"And who paid for them?" inquired Bart
bluntly.</p>

<p>"We didn't, and no questions asked."</p>

<p>"I am afraid your ideas will not make much
impression on my father, if that is what you are
getting at," observed Bart, turning unceremoniously
from Wacker.</p>

<p>"Humph! you fellows ought to run a backwoods
post office," disgustedly grunted the latter,
as he made off.</p>

<p>Bart had only to wait ten minutes when his
father appeared. Except for a slight limp and
some pallor in his face, Mr. Stirling seemed in
his prime. He had kindly eyes and was always
pleasant and smiling, even when in pain.</p>

<p>"Well! well!" he cried briskly, with a gratified
glance at his son after looking over the register,
"all the real hard work is done, the work that
always worries me, with my poor eyesight. Come
up to the paymaster, young man! There's an
advance till salary day, and well you've earned it."</p>

<p>Mr. Stirling took some money from his pocket.
There was a silver dollar and some loose change.
Bart looked pleased, then quite grave, and he put
his hand resolutely behind him.</p>

<p>"I can't take it, father," he said. "You have
a hard enough time, and I ought to pay you for
the experience I'm getting here instead of being
paid."</p>

<p>"Young man," spoke Mr. Stirling with affected
sternness, but a twinkling in his eye, "you take
your half-pay, make tracks, enjoy yourself, and
don't worry about a trifle of a dollar or two. If
you happen to drop around this way about nine
o'clock, I'll be glad of your company home."</p>

<p>He slipped the money into Bart's pocket and
playfully pushed him through the doorway. Bart's
heart was pretty full. He was alive with tenderness
and love for this loyal, patient parent who
had not been over kindly handled by the world in
a money way.</p>

<p>Then a dozen loud explosions over on the hill,
followed by boyish shouts of enthusiasm, made
Bart remember that he was a boy, with all a boy's
lively interest in the Fourth of July foremost in
his thoughts, and he bounded down the tracks
like a whirlwind.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>"WAKING THE NATIVES!"</h3>


<p>Turning the corner of the in-freight house
Bart came to a quick halt.</p>

<p>He had nearly run down a man who sat between
the rails tying his shoe.</p>

<p>The minute Bart set his eyes on the fellow he
remembered having seen him twice before&mdash;both
times in this vicinity, both times looking wretched,
dejected and frightened.</p>

<p>The man started up, frightened now. He
was about forty years old, very shabby and
threadbare in his attire, his thin pale face nearly
covered with a thick shock of hair and full black
beard.</p>

<p>"Hello!" challenged Bart promptly.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's you, young Stirling," muttered the
man, the haunted expression in his eyes giving way
to one of relief.</p>

<p>"Found a job yet?" asked Bart.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;haven't exactly been looking for work,"
responded the man, in an embarrassed way.</p>

<p>"I should think you would," suggested Bart.</p>

<p>"See here," spoke the man, livening up suddenly.
"I'll talk with you, because you're the
only friend I've found hereabouts. I'm in
trouble, and you can call it hiding if you like.
I'm grateful to you for the help you gave me
the other night, for I was pretty nigh starved.
But I don't think you'd better notice me much,
for I'm no good to anybody, and I hope you
won't call attention to my hanging around here."</p>

<p>"Why should I?" inquired Bart, getting interested.
"I want to help you, not harm you. I
feel sorry for you, and I'd like to know a little
more."</p>

<p>A tear coursed down the man's forlorn face and
he shook his head dejectedly.</p>

<p>"You can't sleep forever in empty freight cars,
picking up scraps to live on, you know," said
Bart.</p>

<p>"I'll live there till I find what I came to Pleasantville
to find!" cried the man in a sudden passion.
Then his emotion died down suddenly and
he fell to trembling all over, and cast hasty looks
around as if frightened at his own words.</p>

<p>"Don't mind me," he choked up, starting suddenly
away. "I'm crazy, I guess! I know I'm
about as miserable an object as there is in the
world."</p>

<p>Bart ran after him, drawing a quarter from his
pocket. He detained the man by seizing his arm.</p>

<p>"See here," he said, "you take that, and any
time you're hungry just go up to the house and
tell my mother, will you?"</p>

<p>"Bless her&mdash;and you, too!" murmured the
man, with a hoarse catch in his throat. "I'll take
the money, for I need it desperately bad, but
don't you fret&mdash;it will come back. Yes! it will
come back, double, the day I catch the man who
squeezed all the comfort out of my life!"</p>

<p>He dashed away with a strange cry. Bart, half
decided that he was demented, watched him disappear
in the direction of a cheap eating house
just beyond the tracks, and started homewards
more or less sobered and thoughtful over the
peculiar incident.</p>

<p>It was nearly eight o'clock when Bart got
through with his supper, did his house chores,
mended a broken toy pistol for one junior brother,
made up a list of purchases of torpedoes, baby-crackers
and punk for the other, and helped his
sisters in various ways.</p>

<p>Bart was soon in the midst of the fray. Every
live boy in Pleasantville was in evidence about
the village pleasure grounds, the common and
the hill. Group after group greeted Bart with
excited exclamations. He was a general favorite
with the small boys, always ready to assist or advise
them, and an acknowledged leader with those
of his own age.</p>

<p>He soon found himself quite active in devising
and assisting various minor displays of squibs,
rockets and colored lights. Then he got mixed
up in a general rush for the sheer top of the hill
amid the excited announcement that something
unusual was going on there.</p>

<p>The crowd was met by a current of juvenile
humanity.</p>

<p>"Run!" shouted an excited voice, "she's
going off."</p>

<p>"No, she ain't," pronounced another scoffingly&mdash;"ain't
lighted yet&mdash;no one's got the nerve to
do it."</p>

<p>Bart recognized the last speaker as Dale Wacker,
a nephew of Lem. He had noticed a little earlier
his big brother, Ira, a loutish, overgrown fellow
who had gone around with his hands in his pockets
sneering at the innocent fun the smaller boys
were indulging in, and bragging about his own especial
Fourth of July supply of fireworks which
were to come from some mysterious source not
clearly defined. The Wacker brothers belonged
to a crowd Bart did not train with usually, but as
Dale espied him and seized his arm energetically,
Bart did not draw away, respecting the occasion
and its courtesies.</p>

<p>"You're the very fellow!" declared Dale.</p>

<p>"You bet he is!" cried two others, crowding
up and slapping Bart on the back. "He won't
crawfish. Give him the punk, Dale."</p>

<p>The person addressed extended a lighted piece
of punk.</p>

<p>"Yes, take it, Stirling," he said. "Show him,
boys."</p>

<p>"Yes, you'll have to show me," suggested
Bart significantly. "What's the mystery, anyhow?"</p>

<p>"No mystery at all," answered Dale, "only a
surprise. See it&mdash;well, it's loaded."</p>

<p>"Clean to the muzzle!" bubbled over an excited
urchin.</p>

<p>They were all pointing to the top of the hill.
Bart understood, for clearly outlined against the
light of the rising moon stood the grim old sentinel
that had done duty as a patriotic reminder of
the Civil War for many a year.</p>

<p>"Old Hurricane" the relic cannon had been
dubbed when what was left of Company C, Second
Infantry, came marching back home in the
sixties.</p>

<p>There was not a boy in town who had not
straddled the black ungainly relic, or tried to lift
the heavy cannon balls that symmetrically surrounded
its base support.</p>

<p>Two years before, Colonel Harrington had
erected at his own expense a lofty flagpole at
the side of the cannon and donated an elegant
flag. Every Washington's Birthday and Fourth
of July since, this site had been the center of all
public patriotic festivities, and the headquarters
for celebrating for juvenile Pleasantville.</p>

<p>Bart was a little startled as he comprehended
what was in the wind. He thrilled a trifle; his
eyes sparkled brightly.</p>

<p>"It's all right, Stirling," assured Dale Wacker.
"We cleaned out the barrel and we've rammed
home a good solid charge, with a long fuse ready
to light. Guess it will stir up the sleepy old
town for once, hey?"</p>

<p>Bart was in for any harmless sport, yet he
fumbled the lighted piece of punk undecidedly.</p>

<p>"I don't know about this, fellows"&mdash;he began.</p>

<p>"Oh! don't spoil the fun, Stirling," pleaded
little Ned Sawyer, a rare favorite with Bart.
"We asked one-legged Dacy on the quiet. He
was in the war, and he says the gun can't burst, or
anything."</p>

<p>The crowd kept pushing Bart forward in eager
excitement.</p>

<p>"Why don't you light it yourself?" inquired
Bart of Dale.</p>

<p>"I've sprained my foot&mdash;limping now," explained
young Wacker. "She may kick, you
see, and soon as you light her you want to scoot."</p>

<p>"Go ahead, Bart! touch her off," implored
little Sawyer, quivering with excitement.</p>

<p>"Whoop! hurrah!" yelled a frantic chorus
as Bart took a voluntary step up the hill.</p>

<p>That decided him&mdash;patriotism was in the air and
he was fully infected. One or two of the larger
boys advanced with him, but halted at a safe
distance, while the younger ones danced about
and stuck their fingers in their ears, screaming.</p>

<p>Bart got to the side of the cannon. It was silhouetted
in the landscape on a slight slant towards
the stately mansion and grounds of Colonel Harrington,
in full view at all times of the magnate
who had improved its surroundings.</p>

<p>Bart made out a long fuse trailing three feet or
more over the side of the old fieldpiece. He
blew the punk to a bright glow.</p>

<p>"Ready!" he called back merrily over his
shoulder.</p>

<p>The hillside vibrated with the flutter of expectant
juvenile humanity and a vast babel of half-suppressed
excited voices.</p>

<p>Bart applied the punk, there was a fizz, a
sharp hiss, a writhing worm of quick flame, and
then came a fearful report that split the air like
the crack of doom.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>COUNTING THE COST</h3>


<p>Bart had quickly moved to one side of the cannon
after lighting the fuse, and was about twenty
feet away when the explosion came.</p>

<p>The alarming echoes, the shock, flare and
smoke combined to give him a terrific sensation.</p>

<p>The crowd that had retreated down the hill in
delightful trepidation now came trooping back
filled with a bolder excitement.</p>

<p>They had indeed "waked the natives," for gazing
downhill against the lights of the street and
stores at its base they could see people rushing
outdoors in palpable agitation.</p>

<p>Some were staring up the hill in wonder and
terror, others were starting for its summit, among
them two village officials, as demonstrated by the
silver stars they wore.</p>

<p>"They heard it&mdash;it woke 'em up, right
enough!" shrieked little Sawyer in a frenzy
of happiness.</p>

<p>"Look yonder!" piped a second breathless
voice. "Say, I thought I heard something
strike."</p>

<p>Dale Wacker came upon the scene&mdash;not
limping, but chuckling and winking to the cronies
at his back.</p>

<p>"Pretty good aim, eh, fellows?" he gloated.
"Stirling, you're a capital gunner."</p>

<p>All eyes were now turned in a new direction&mdash;in
that whither the muzzle of the cannon was
pointed.</p>

<p>The grounds of the Harrington mansion were
the scene of a vivid commotion. The porch lights
had been abruptly turned on, and they flooded
the lawn in front with radiance.</p>

<p>Bart gasped, thrilled, and experienced a strange
qualm of dismay. He discerned in a flash that
something heretofore always prominently present
on the Harrington landscape was not now in
evidence.</p>

<p>The wealthy colonel was given to "grandstand
plays," and one of them had been the placing of
a bronze pedestal and statue at the side of the
driveway.</p>

<p>It bore the inscription "1812," and according to
the colonel, portrayed a military man life-size,
epaulettes, sword, uniform and all&mdash;his maternal
grandfather as he had appeared in the battle scene
where he had lost a limb.</p>

<p>Now, in effigy, the valiant warrior was prostrate.
The colonel's servants were rushing to the spot
where the statue had tumbled over on the velvety
sward.</p>

<p>"See here!"&mdash;cried Bart stormingly, turning
on Dale Wacker.</p>

<p>"Loaded," significantly observed the latter
with a diabolical grin.</p>

<p>A rush of keen realization made Bart
shiver. He recognized what the foolhardy
escapade might have cost had that whirling
cannon ball met a human, instead of an inanimate,
target.</p>

<p>As it was, he easily calculated the indignation
and resentment of the haughty village magnate
who was given to outbursts of wrath which carried
all before him.</p>

<p>"You've spoiled my Fourth," began Bart in a
tumult. "I'll spoil your&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Cut for it, fellows! they're coming for
us!"</p>

<p>"They" were the village officers. Bart had
made a jump towards Dale Wacker, but the latter
had faded into the vortex of pell-mell fugitives
rushing away downhill to hiding.</p>

<p>Bart put after them, trying to single out the
author of the scurvy joke that he knew had serious
trouble at the end of it.</p>

<p>"Hold on!" gasped a breathless voice.</p>

<p>"Don't stop me!" shouted Bart, trying to tear
loose from a frantic grip. "Oh, it's you&mdash;what
do you want?"</p>

<p>He halted to survey the person who detained
him&mdash;the man who haunted the freight tracks&mdash;to
whom he had given money earlier in the evening.</p>

<p>"Come, quick!" the man panted. "Express
shed&mdash;where your father is&mdash;trouble. Don't wait&mdash;not
a minute."</p>

<p>"See here," challenged Bart, instantly startled
into a new tremor of anxiety, "what do you
mean?"</p>

<p>But the forlorn roustabout could not be coherent.
He continued to gasp and splutter out excited
adjectives, fragmentary sentences.</p>

<p>"Plot&mdash;get you into trouble&mdash;father&mdash;I
heard 'em."</p>

<p>Then as his glance fell upon the people coming
up the hill, the officers in their lead, his eyes
bulged with terror, he grasped Bart's arm, let out
an unearthly yell of fear, and by sheer force carried
Bart pell-mell down the other side of the hill
with him.</p>

<p>"See here," panted Bart, as, still running,
they were headed in the direction of the railroad,
"my business is here. Don't you hurry me off
in this fashion unless there's something to it."</p>

<p>"Told you&mdash;express shed&mdash;robbers!"</p>

<p>"Robbers? You mean some one is stealing
something there?"</p>

<p>"Yes!" gulped Bart's companion.</p>

<p>"Who is it?"</p>

<p>"Don't know."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you stop them?"</p>

<p>"I don't dare do anything," the man wailed.
"I'm a poor, miserable object, but I'm your
friend. I heard two fellows whispering on the
tracks near the express shed. Said they were
going to steal some fireworks. I ran to the shed
to warn your father. He was asleep in his chair.
They might see me&mdash;didn't dare do anything."</p>

<p>Bart now believed there might be some basis
to the man's statements. He plunged forward
alone, not conscious that he was outdistancing
his late companion.</p>

<p>Reaching the tracks, Bart ran down a line of
freights. The express shed was in view at last.
It was lighted up as usual, the door stood open,
and nothing suggested anything out of the ordinary.</p>

<p>"The fellow's cracked," reflected Bart.
"Everything looks straight here&mdash;no, it doesn't!"
He checked himself abruptly. "Here! what are
you at?"</p>

<p>Sharp and clear Bart sang out. Approaching
the express shed from the side, his glance shifted
to the rear.</p>

<p>The little structure had one window there,
lightly barred with metal strips. Two men stood
on the platform beneath it. One of them had
just pried a strip loose with some long implement
he held in his hand. The other had just pushed
up the sash by reaching through the convenient
aperture thus made.</p>

<p>Bart bounded to the platform with a nimble
spring. As his feet clamped down warningly on
the boardway, the man who had pushed up the
window turned sharply.</p>

<p>"It's young Stirling!" Bart heard him mutter.
"Drop it, and run."</p>

<p>The speaker sprang to the ground and disappeared
around the corner of the shed with the
words.</p>

<p>His companion, who had been stooping on
one knee in his prying operations, essayed to join
him, slipped, tilted over, and before he could recover
himself Bart was upon him.</p>

<p>"What are you about here?" demanded the
latter.</p>

<p>The prisoner was of man-like build and proportions.
He did not speak, and tried to keep
his features hidden from the rays of the near
switch light.</p>

<p>"Lemme go!" he mouthed, with purposely
subdued intonation.</p>

<p>"Not till I know who you are&mdash;not till I find
out what you're up to," declared Bart. "Turn
around here. I'll stick closer than a brother till
I see that face of yours!"</p>

<p>He swung his captive towards the light, but a
broad-peaked cap and the partial disguise of a
crudely blackened face defeated his purpose.</p>

<p>Bart was about to shout to his father in front,
or to his roustabout friend, whom he expected must
be somewhere near by this time, when his captive
gave a jerk, tore one arm free, and whirled the
other aloft.</p>

<p>His hand clenched the implement he had used
to pry away the bars, and Bart now saw what
it was.</p>

<p>The object the mysterious robber was utilizing
for burglarious purposes, was the signal flag used
at the switch shanty where Lem Wacker had been
doing substitute duty that day.</p>

<p>It consisted of a three foot iron rod, sharpened
at the end. At the blunt end the strip of red flag
was wound, near the sharp end the conventional
track torpedo was held in place by its
tin strap.</p>

<p>"Lemme go"; again growled the man.</p>

<p>"Never!" declared Bart.</p>

<p>The man's left arm was free, and he swung the
iron rod aloft. Bart saw it descending, aimed
straight for his head. If he held on to the man
he could scarcely evade it.</p>

<p>He let go his grip, ducked, made a pass to grasp
the burglar's ankle, but missed it.</p>

<p>An explosion, a sharp flare, a keen shock filled
the air, and before Bart could grip the man afresh
he had sprung from the platform and vanished.</p>

<p>At the same instant the flag rod clattered to the
boards, and a second later, rubbing his face free
from sudden pricking grains of powder, Bart saw
what had happened.</p>

<p>The blow intended for him had landed upon
one of the iron bars of the window with a force
that exploded the track torpedo.</p>

<p>It had flared out one broad spiteful breath,
sending a shower of sparks among the big mass
of fireworks in the storage room, and amid a thousand
hissing, snapping explosions the express shed
was in flames.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>BLIND FOR LIFE</h3>


<p>Bart's first thought was of his father. He
instantly leaped from the platform.</p>

<p>As he did so there was a violent explosion in
the storage room, the sashes were blown from
place outright, and Bart dodged to escape a
shower of glass.</p>

<p>He was fairly appalled at the suddenness with
which the flames enveloped the interior, for they
shot up in every direction, and the partition dividing
the shed appeared blown from place.</p>

<p>Rockets were fizzing, giant crackers exploding
by the pack, and colored chemicals sending out
a varied glow.</p>

<p>Bart dashed for the front&mdash;a muffled cry caused
him to hurry his speed. His father had uttered
the cry.</p>

<p>Dazed by the light, his eyes filled with smarting
particles of burned powder, Bart suddenly
came in violent contact with a human form just
as he turned the corner of the shed.</p>

<p>Both nearly upset in the collision. At first
Bart fancied it might be one of the burglars, but
peering closer he recognized the friendly roustabout.</p>

<p>"Told you so!" gasped the latter in a desperate
fluster. "Fire&mdash;I'll help you."</p>

<p>"Yes, quick! run," breathed Bart, rushing
ahead, "My father's in that burning building!"</p>

<p>Bart was thrilled. The main room of the express
shed was one bright blur of brilliancy and
colored smoke.</p>

<p>It rolled and whirled, obliterating all outlines
within the room.</p>

<p>"Father! father!" shouted Bart, dashing recklessly
in at the open doorway.</p>

<p>He could not make out a single object in that
chaos, but he knew the location of every familiar
article in the place, and made for the chair in which
his father usually sat.</p>

<p>"Father!" he screamed, as his hands touched
the arms of the chair and found it empty.</p>

<p>The sulphurous flames nearly choked him, the
heat from the crackling wooden partition singed
his hair, but he could only grope about blindly.</p>

<p>"Here he is," sounded a suffocating voice.</p>

<p>"Where, oh! where?" panted Bart.</p>

<p>He threw out his arms wildly, groping to locate
the speaker, whom he knew to be the roustabout.
"Where is he&mdash;where is he?"</p>

<p>He had come in contact with the roustabout
now, who with all his timidity was proving himself
a hero in the present instance.</p>

<p>"Lying on the floor&mdash;stumbled over him&mdash;I'm
on fire, too!"</p>

<p>Bart's feet touched a prostrate form. It was
moved along as Bart stooped and got hold of the
shoulders.</p>

<p>The roustabout was helping him. They
dragged together, stumbling to the doorway on
the very verge of fatal danger, and reeled across
the platform.</p>

<p>The roustabout jumped to the ground. Once
there he gently but in a masterly way drew the inanimate
form of Mr. Stirling from the platform,
and carried him over to a pile of ties outside of the
glow and scorch of the burning express shed.</p>

<p>Bart anxiously scanned his father's face. It was
black and blistered but he was breathing naturally.</p>

<p>"Overcome with the smoke&mdash;or tumbled and
was stunned," declared the roustabout.</p>

<p>Excited approaching shouts caused the speaker
to glare down the tracks. Half a dozen people
were hurrying to the scene of the fire. The roustabout
with a nervous gasp vanished in the darkness.</p>

<p>Bart was hovering over his father in a solicitous
way as a night watchman and a freight crew appeared
on the scene. There was a volley of excited
questions and quick responses.</p>

<p>No means of extinguishing the flames were at
hand. The newcomers suggested getting the insensible
Mr. Stirling over to the street beyond the
tracks a few hundred yards distant, where there
was a drug store.</p>

<p>Bart ran for the hand truck on the platform,
saw two of the men start off with his father on it,
and hurried back to the burning express shed.</p>

<p>He had hoped to save something, but one effort
drove him back, realizing the foolhardiness of repeating
the experiment. The building and its
contents were doomed.</p>

<p>The crowd began to gather and grew with the
moments. A road official appeared on the scene.
Bart made a brief, hurried explanation and ran over
to the drug store.</p>

<p>To his surprise his father was not there. Bart
approached the druggist to ask an anxious question
when the companion of the latter, a professional-looking
man, spoke up.</p>

<p>"You are young Stirling, are you not?" he
interrogated.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," nodded Bart.</p>

<p>"Don't get frightened or worried, but I am Doctor
Davis. We thought it best to send your father
to the hospital."</p>

<p>"To the hospital!" echoed Bart turning pale.
"Then he is badly injured&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not at all," dissented the physician reassuringly.
"He was probably overcome by the smoke
or fell and was stunned, but that injury was trifling.
It is his eyes we are troubled about."</p>

<p>"Tell me the worst!" pleaded Bart in a choked
tone, but trying to prepare himself for the shock.</p>

<p>"Why, one eye is pretty bad," said the doctor,
"and the other got the full force of some powder
explosion. They have good people up at the hospital,
though, and they will soon get him to rights."</p>

<p>"I must tell my mother at once," murmured
Bart.</p>

<p>He left the place with a heart as heavy as lead.
It seemed as if one furious Fourth of July powder
blast had disrupted the very foundations of all the
family hopes and happiness, leaving a blackened
wreck where there had been unity, comfort and
peace.</p>

<p>If his father was disabled seriously, their prospects
became a very grave problem. Bart, too,
was worried about the loss to the express company.
The books were probably out on the desk
when the fire commenced, the safe was open, and
the loss in money and records meant considerable.</p>

<p>Bart felt that he was undertaking the hardest
task of his life when he reached home and broke
the news to his mother&mdash;it was like disturbing the
peace of some earthly Eden.</p>

<p>Mrs. Stirling went at once to the hospital with
her eldest daughter, Bertha. Bart, very anxious
and miserable, got the younger boys to bed and
tried to cheer up his little sister Alice, who was
in a transport of grief and suspense.</p>

<p>The strain was relieved when Bertha Stirling
came home about eleven o'clock.</p>

<p>She was in tears, but subdued any active
exhibition of emotion until Alice, on the assurance
that her father was resting comfortably at
the hospital, was induced to retire.</p>

<p>Then she broke down utterly, and Bart had a
hard time keeping her from being hysterical.</p>

<p>She said that her mother intended staying all
night at the side of her suffering husband and
had tried to send some reassuring word to her
son.</p>

<p>"You must tell me the worst, you know,
Bertha," said Bart. "What do they say at the
hospital? Is father in serious danger? Will
he die?"</p>

<p>"No," answered the sobbing girl, "he will
not die, but oh! Bart&mdash;the doctor says he may be
blind for life!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>READY FOR BUSINESS</h3>


<p>Bart Stirling stood ruefully regarding the
ruins of the burned express shed. It was the
Fourth of July, and early as it was, the air
was resonant with the usual echoes of Independance
Day.</p>

<p>Bart, however, was little in harmony with the
jollity and excitement of the occasion. He had
spent a sleepless night, tossing and rolling in bed
until daybreak, when his mother returned from
the hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. Stirling was resting easily, she reported, in
very little pain or discomfort, but his career of
usefulness and work was over&mdash;the doctors expressed
an opinion that he would never regain
his eyesight.</p>

<p>Mrs. Stirling was pale and sorrowed. She
had grown older in a single night, but the calm
resignation in her gentle face assured Bart that
they would be of one mind in taking up their
new burdens of life in a practical, philosophical
way.</p>

<p>"Poor father!" he murmured brokenly. Then
he added: "Mother, I want you to go in and
get some rest, and try not to take this too hard.
I will attend to everything there is to do about
the express office."</p>

<p>"I don't see what there can be to do," she
responded in surprise. "Everything is burned
up, your father will never be able to resume his
position. We are through with all that, I
fancy."</p>

<p>"There is considerable to do," asserted Bart
in a definite tone that instantly attracted his
mother's attention because of its seriousness.
"Father is a bonded employee of the express
service. Their business doesn't stop because of
an accidental fire, and they have a system to look
after here that must not be neglected. I know
the ropes pretty well, thanks to father, and I
think it a matter of duty to act just as he would
were he able to be about, and further and protect
the company's interests. Outside of that,
mother," continued the boy, earnestly, "you
don't suppose I am going to sit down idly
and let things drift at haphazard, with the family
to take care of and everything to be done to
make it easy and comfortable for father."</p>

<p>A look of pride came into the mother's face.
She completely recognized the fidelity and sense
of her loyal son, allowed Bart to lead her into the
house, and tried to be calm and cheerful when he
bade her good-bye, and, evading celebrating
groups of his boy friends, made his way down to
the ruined express shed.</p>

<p>A heap of still smouldering cinders and ashes
marked the site. Bart stood silently ruminating
for some minutes. He tried to think things out
clearly, to decide how far he was warranted in
acting for his father.</p>

<p>"I don't exactly know what action the express
people usually take in a case of this kind," he reflected,
"nor how soon they get about it. I can
only wait for some official information. In the
meantime, though, somebody has got to keep the
ball rolling here. I seem to be the only one
about, and I am going to put the system in some
temporary order at least. If I'm called down
later for being too officious, they can't say I didn't
try to do my duty."</p>

<p>Bart set briskly at work to put into motion
a plan his quick, sensible mind had suggested.</p>

<p>About one hundred feet away was a rough unpainted
shed-like structure. He remembered the
time, several years back, when the express office
had been located there.</p>

<p>It was, however, forty feet from any tracks, and
for convenience sake, when the railroad gave
up the burned building which they had occupied
for unclaimed freight storage, it had been turned
over to the express people.</p>

<p>Bart went down to the old quarters. The door
had lost its padlock and stood half open. Inside
was a heap of old boards, and empty boxes and
barrels thrown there from time to time to keep
them from littering the yards.</p>

<p>A truck and the little delivery cart, being outside
of the burned shed, Bart found intact. He
ran them down to the building he had determined
to utilize, temporarily at least, as express headquarters
for Pleasantville.</p>

<p>The yards were fairly deserted except for a
sleepy night watchman here and there. It was
not yet seven o'clock, but when Bart reached the
in-freight house he found it open and one or two
clerks hurrying through their work so as to get
off for the day at ten.</p>

<p>There was a good deal of questioning, for they
knew of the fire, and knew Bart as well, and liked
him, and when he made his wants known willing
hands ministered to his needs.</p>

<p>Bart carried back with him a hammer and some
nails, a broom, a marking pot and brush, pens,
ink and a couple of tabs of paper.</p>

<p>As he neared the switch shanty where Lem
Wacker had been on duty the day previous, he
noticed that it had been opened up since he
had passed it last. Some one was grumbling
noisily inside. Bart was curious for more reasons
than one.</p>

<p>He placed his load on the bench outside
and stuck his head in through the open doorway.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's you, Mr. Evans," he hailed, as
he recognized the regular flagman on duty for
whom Wacker had been substituting for three
days past. "Glad to see you back. Are you
all well?"</p>

<p>"Eh? oh, young Stirling. Say, you've had
a fire. I hear your father was burned."</p>

<p>"He is quite seriously hurt," answered Bart
gravely.</p>

<p>"Too bad. I have troubles of my own,
though."</p>

<p>"What is the matter, Mr. Evans?"</p>

<p>"Next time I give that lazy, good-for-nothing
Lem Wacker work he'll know it, I'm thinking!
Look there&mdash;and there!"</p>

<p>The irate old railroader kicked over the wooden
cuspidor in disgust. It was loaded to the top
with tobacco and cigarette ends. Then he cast
out half a dozen empty bottles through the
open window, and went on with his grumbling.</p>

<p>"What he's been up to is more than I can
guess," he vociferated. "Look at my table
there, all burned with matches and covered with
burnt cork. What's he been doing with burnt
cork? Running a minstrel show?"</p>

<p>Bart gave a start. He thought instantly of
the black streaked face he had tried to survey at
the express shed window the night previous.</p>

<p>"My flag's gone, too," muttered old Evans,
turning over things in a vain search for it. "I'll
have a word or two for Lem Wacker when it
comes to settling day, I'm thinking. He comes
up to the house late last night and tells me
he don't care to work for me any longer."</p>

<p>"Did he?" murmured Bart thoughtfully.
"Why not, I wonder?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he flared up big and lofty, and said he
had a better job in view."</p>

<p>Bart went on his way surmising a good deal and
suspecting more.</p>

<p>He made it a point to pass by the ruins of the
old express shed, and he found there what he expected
to find&mdash;the missing flag from the switch
shanty; only the rod was bare, the little piece of
red bunting having been burned away.</p>

<p>Bart dismissed this matter from his mind and all
other disturbing extraneous affairs, massing all his
faculties for the time being on getting properly
equipped for business.</p>

<p>He selected a clean, plain board, and with the
marking outfit painted across it in six-inch letters
that could be plainly read at a distance the words:</p>

<p>EXPRESS OFFICE.</p>

<p>This Bart nailed to the door jamb in such a way
that it was visible from three directions.</p>

<p>Next he started to carry outside and pile neatly
at the blind end of the building all the boards,
boxes and other debris littering up the room, swept
it, and selected two packing cases and nailed them
up into a convenient impromptu desk, manufactured
a bench seat out of some loose boards, set
his pen, ink and paper in order, and felt quite
ready for business.</p>

<p>He had gained a pretty clear idea the day previous
from his father as to the Fourth of July
express service routine.</p>

<p>The fireworks deliveries had been the main
thing, but as these had been destroyed that part of
the programme was off the sheet.</p>

<p>At eight o'clock the morning express would
bring in its usual quota, but this would be held
over until the following day except what was
marked special or perishable. There would be no
out express matter owing to the fact that it was
a holiday.</p>

<p>"I can manage nicely, I think," Bart told himself,
as, an hour later, he ran the truck down to
the site of the burned express shed and stood by
the tracks waiting.</p>

<p>A freight engine soon came to the spot, backing
down the express car. Its engineer halted
with a jerk and a vivid:</p>

<p>"Hello!"</p>

<p>He had not heard of the fire, and he stared with
interest at the ruins as Bart explained that, until
some new arrangement was made, express shipments
would be accepted and loaded by truck.</p>

<p>There were four big freezers of ice cream, one
for delivery at the town confectioner's, one at the
drug store soda fountain, and two for the picnic
grounds, where an afternoon celebration was on
the programme. Besides these, there were three
packages containing flags and fireworks, marked
"Delayed&mdash;Rush."</p>

<p>He closed the office door, tacked to it a
card announcing he would return inside of half
an hour, and loaded into the wagon the entire
morning's freight except the two freezers intended
for the picnic grounds.</p>

<p>These could not be delivered until two o'clock
that afternoon, and he stowed them in the new
express shed, covering them carefully with their
canvas wrappings.</p>

<p>Bart made a record run in his deliveries.
He had formed a rough receipt book out of
some loose sheets, and when he came back
to the office filled out his entries in regular
form.</p>

<p>Several persons visited the place up to nine
o'clock&mdash;storekeepers and others who had lost their
goods in the fire. Bart explained the situation,
saying that they would probably hear from the express
company in a day or two regarding their
claims.</p>

<p>He found in work something to change his
thoughts from a gloomy channel, and, while very
anxious about his father, was thankful his parent
had escaped with his life, while he indulged some
hopeful and daring plans for his own ambitions in
the near future.</p>

<p>"I'll stick to my post," he decided. "Some
of the express people may happen down here any
time."</p>

<p>He was making up a list from memory of those
in the village whose packages had been destroyed
by the fire, when two boys crossed the threshold of
the open doorway, one carrying a thin flat
package.</p>

<p>Bart greeted them pleasantly. The elder was
Darry Haven, his companion a younger brother,
Bob, both warm friends of the young express
agent.</p>

<p>Darry inquired for Mr. Stirling solicitously, and
said his mother was then on her way to see Mrs.
Stirling, anxious to do anything she could to share
the lady's troubles. Mr. Haven had been an editor,
but his health had failed, and Mrs. Haven,
having some artistic ability and experience, was
the main present support of the family, doing considerable
work for a publishing house in the city in
the way of illustrations for fashion pages.</p>

<p>Darry had a "rush" package of illustrations
under his arm now.</p>

<p>"I suppose we can't get anything through
to-day, or until you get things in running order
again?" he intimated.</p>

<p>"We were sending nothing through on account
of the Fourth," explained Bart, "but you leave the
package here and I will see that it goes on the
eleven o'clock train."</p>

<p>Bart had just completed the fire-loss list when
a heavy step caused him to turn around.</p>

<p>A portly, well-dressed man, important-appearing
and evidently on business, stood in the doorway
looking sharply about the place.</p>

<p>"Well!" he uttered, "What's this?"</p>

<p>"The express office," said Bart, arising.</p>

<p>"Oh, it is?" slowly commented the man,
"You in charge?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," politely answered Bart.</p>

<p>"Set up shop; doing business, eh?"</p>

<p>"Fast as I can," announced Bart.</p>

<p>"Who told you to?" demanded the visitor
bending a pair of stern eyes on Bart.</p>

<p>"Why do you ask that, may I inquire?" interrogated
Bart, pleasantly, but standing his
ground.</p>

<p>"Ha-hum!" retorted the stranger, "why do
ask. Because I am the superintendent of the express
company, young man, and somewhat interested
in knowing, I fancy!"</p>

<h3>GETTING "SATISFACTION"</h3>


<p>Bart did not lose his presence of mind, but he
fully realized that he faced a critical moment in his
career.</p>

<p>Very courteously he drew forward the rude impromptu
bench he had knocked together two
hours before.</p>

<p>"Will you have a seat, sir?" he asked.</p>

<p>The express superintendent did not lose his
dignity, but there was a slightly humorous twitching
at the corners of his mouth.</p>

<p>"Thanks," he said, wearily seating himself on
the rude structure. "Rather primitive furniture
for a big express company, it seems to me."</p>

<p>"It was the best I could provide under the
circumstances," explained Bart modestly.</p>

<p>"You made this bench, did you?"</p>

<p>Bart acknowledged the imputation with a nod.</p>

<p>"And that&mdash;desk, is it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And the sign outside, and opened for business?"</p>

<p>"There was no one else on hand. I felt that
I must represent my father, Mr. Stirling, who is
the authorized agent here, until the seriousness of
his condition was known. You see, there was
business likely to come in, and I have been here
to attend to it."</p>

<p>"Just so," vouchsafed his visitor. "No out
shipments to-day, I believe?"</p>

<p>"No, it's a holiday, but there was some rush in
stuff on the morning express."</p>

<p>"Where is it?"</p>

<p>"I have delivered most of it&mdash;the balance, two
freezers of ice cream, I will attend to this afternoon.
I am keeping a record and taking receipts,
but giving none&mdash;I didn't feel warranted in that
until I heard from the company."</p>

<p>"You have done very well, young man," said
the stranger. "I am Robert Leslie, the superintendent,
as I told you. Do you mean to say
you rigged things up in this shape and got your
deliveries out alone?"</p>

<p>"There was no one to help me," remarked
Bart.</p>

<p>He felt pleased and encouraged, for the superintendent's
cast-iron visage had softened considerably,
and he manifested unmistakable interest as
he reached out and took up and inspected the
neatly formulated memoranda on the packing-box
desk.</p>

<p>"What's this?" he inquired, running over the
pages Bart had last been working on.</p>

<p>"That is a list of losers by the fire," explained
Bart.</p>

<p>"This is from memory?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Leslie&mdash;but I have a good one,
and I think the list is tolerably correct."</p>

<p>"I am very much pleased," admitted the superintendent&mdash;"those
claims are our main anxiety
in a case like this. I understand the contents of
the safe were destroyed."</p>

<p>"I fear so," assented Bart gravely. "The explosion
was so sudden, and my father was blinded,
so there was no opportunity to close it. I tried
to reach it after rescuing him, but the flames
drove me back."</p>

<p>Mr. Leslie was silent for a few moments. He
seemed to be thinking. His glance roamed
speculatively about the place, taking in the layout
critically, then finally Bart was conscious that his
shrewd, burrowing eyes were scanning him
closely.</p>

<p>"How old are you, Stirling?" asked the superintendent
abruptly.</p>

<p>"Nearly nineteen."</p>

<p>"I suppose you know something about the
routine here?"</p>

<p>"I have helped my father a little for the past
month or two&mdash;yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And have improved your opportunities,
judging from the common-sense way you have
got things into temporary running order," commented
Leslie.</p>

<p>The speaker took out his watch. Then, glancing
through the doorway, he arose suddenly, with
the words:</p>

<p>"Ah! there he is, now. I suppose you
couldn't be here about four o'clock this afternoon?"</p>

<p>"Why, certainly," answered Bart promptly.
"People are likely to be around making inquiries,
and I have a delivery to make this afternoon, as
I told you, sir."</p>

<p>"I intend to see your father," said Mr. Leslie,
"and I want to get back to the city to-night. I
may have some orders for you, so we'll call it
four, sharp."</p>

<p>"I will be here, sir."</p>

<p>The superintendent stepped outside. Evidently
he had made an appointment, for he was
met by the freight agent of the B. &amp; M., who
knew Bart and nodded to him.</p>

<p>As the two men strolled slowly over to the ruins
of the express shed, Bart heard Mr. Leslie remark:</p>

<p>"That's a smart boy in there."</p>

<p>"And a good one," supplemented the freight
agent.</p>

<p>Bart experienced a thrill of pleasure at the
homely compliment. He tried to get back to
business, but he found himself considerably flustered.</p>

<p>All the morning his hopes and plans had
drifted in one definite direction&mdash;to get some
assurance of permanent employment for the
future.</p>

<p>The only work he had ever done was here at
the express office for his father. It was a daring
prospect to imagine that he, a mere boy, would
be allowed to succeed to a grown man's position
and salary&mdash;and yet Bart had placed himself in
line for it with every prompting of diligence and
duty.</p>

<p>Mr. Leslie and the freight agent spent half an
hour at the ruins. Bart could see by their gestures
that they were animatedly discussing the
situation, and they seemed to be closely looking
over the ground with a view to locating a site for
a new express shed.</p>

<p>Finally they shook hands in parting. The express
superintendent consulted his watch, and
turned his face in the direction of Bart.</p>

<p>As he neared the "new" express shed, however,
he passed around to its rear, and glancing
out of a window there Bart saw that he had come
to a halt, and was drawing a diagram of the
tracks on a blank page in his memorandum book.</p>

<p>Just as Mr. Leslie had returned this to his
pocket and was about to start from the spot, a
man hailed him. It was Lem Wacker. He
was dressed in his best, but the effort was spoiled
by an uncertainty of gait, and his face was suspiciously
flushed.</p>

<p>"Did you address me?" inquired the superintendent
in a chilling tone.</p>

<p>Lem was not daunted by the imposing presence
or the dignified demeanor of the speaker.</p>

<p>"Sure," he answered, unabashed. "You're
Leslie, ain't you?"</p>

<p>"I am Mr. Leslie, yes," corrected the superintendent,
his stern brow contracted in a frown.</p>

<p>"They told me I'd find you here. My name's
Wacker. Knew your cousin down at Rochelle;
we worked on the same desk in the freight house.
Had many a drink with Ted Leslie."</p>

<p>"What do you want?" challenged the superintendent,
turning on his heel.</p>

<p>"Why, it's this way," explained the dauntless
Lem: "I'm an old railroader and a handy man of
experience, I am, and I wanted to make a proposition
to you. You see&mdash;"</p>

<p>Bart lost the remainder of Mr. Lem Wacker's
proposition, for Mr. Leslie had started forward
impatiently, with Lem persistently following in
his wake. He was still keeping up the pursuit
and importuning the affronted official as both
were lost to view behind a track of freights.</p>

<p>Bart of course surmised that Lem Wacker was
on the trail of the "better job" he had announced
he was after to the old switchman, Evans.</p>

<p>"I don't think he has made a very promising
impression," decided Bart, as he got back to his
writing.</p>

<p>"Say, you!"</p>

<p>Bart looked up a trifle startled at the sharp
hail, ten minutes later. He had been engrossed
in his work and had not noticed an intruder.</p>

<p>Lem Wacker stood just in the doorway. He
looked flushed, excited and vicious.</p>

<p>"What can I do for you, Mr. Wacker?" inquired
Bart calmly, though scenting trouble in the
air.</p>

<p>"You can undo!" flared out Wacker, "and
you'll get quick action on it, or I'll clean you out,
bag and baggage."</p>

<p>"There isn't much baggage here to clean out,"
suggested Bart humorously, "and as for the rest
of it I'll try to take care of it myself."</p>

<p>"Oh! you will, will you?" sneered Lem, lurching
to and fro. "You're a sneak. Bart Stirling&mdash;a
low, contemptible sneak, that's what you are!"</p>

<p>"I would like to have you explain," remarked
Bart.</p>

<p>"You've queered me!" roared Wacker, "and
I'm going to have satisfaction&mdash;yes, sir. Sat-is-fac-tion!"</p>

<p>He pounded out the syllables under Bart's very
nose with resounding thumps, bringing down his
fist on the impromptu office desk so forcibly that
the concussion disturbed the papers on it, and
several sheets fell fluttering to the floor.</p>

<p>Bart's patience was tried. His eyes flashed,
but he stooped and picked up the pages and replaced
them on the dry goods box.</p>

<p>"Don't you do that again," he warned in a
strained tone.</p>

<p>"Why!" yelled Wacker, rolling up his cuffs.</p>

<p>"I'll trim you next! 'Don't-do-it-again!' eh?
Boo! bah!"</p>

<p>Lem raised his foot and kicked over the desk,
papers and all.</p>

<p>"That's express company property," observed
Bart quietly, but his blood was up, the limit
reached. "Get out!"</p>

<p>One arm shot forward, and the clenched muscular
fist rested directly under the chin of the astounded
Lem Wacker.</p>

<p>"And stay out."</p>

<p>Lem Wacker felt a smart whack, went whirling
back over the threshold, and the next instant
measured his length, sprawling on the ground
outside of the express shed.</p>

<h3>WAITING FOR TROUBLE</h3>


<p>Lem Wacker rolled over, then sat up, rubbed
his head in a half-dazed manner, and muttered in
a silly, sheepish way.</p>

<p>"Lem Wacker," said Bart, "I have got just a
few words to say to you, and that ends matters
between us. I am sorry I had to strike you, but
I will have no man interfering with the express
company's affairs. I want you to go away, and if
you ever come in here again except on business
strictly there will be trouble."</p>

<p>Lem did not put up much of a belligerent
front, though he tried still to look ugly and
dangerous.</p>

<p>He got his balance at last, and extended his
finger at our hero.</p>

<p>"Bart Stirling," he maundered, "you've made
an enemy for life. Look out for me! You're
a marked man after this."</p>

<p>"What am I marked with," inquired Bart
quickly&mdash;"burnt cork?"</p>

<p>"Hey! What?" blurted out Lem, and Bart
saw that the shot had struck the target. Wacker
looked sickly, and muttered something to himself.
Then he took himself off.</p>

<p>Bart's worries were pleasantly broken in upon
by the arrival of his sister Bertha. She brought
him a generous lunch, the first food Bart had
tasted that day, and his appetite welcomed it in a
wholesome way.</p>

<p>He put in the time planning what he would do
if he was lucky enough to be retained in his
father's position, and what he might do in case
someone else was appointed.</p>

<p>At half-past two Bart loaded the two ice cream
freezers on the cart and started for the picnic
grounds.</p>

<p>Juvenile Pleasantville had somewhat subsided
for a time in the fervor of its patriotism. There
was a lull in the popping and banging, nearly
everybody in town being due at the time-honored
celebration in the picnic grove.</p>

<p>When Bart reached the grove, someone was
making an address, and he piloted his way circumspectly
up to the side of the platform where the
speaking was going on.</p>

<p>He deposited the freezers inside the bunting-decorated
inclosure, where half a dozen young
ladies were posted to dispense the refreshments
after the literary programme was finished.</p>

<p>Bart started to return with his empty cart the
way he had come, but about ten feet from the
platform paused for a moment to take in the
exceptionally flowery sentiment that was being
enunciated by the speaker of the day.</p>

<p>Colonel Harrington, it seemed, was the self-appointed
hero of the occasion. The great man
of the village was in his element&mdash;the eyes
and ears of all Pleasantville fixed upon him.</p>

<p>In rolling tones and with magnificent gestures
he was paying a lofty tribute to the immortal
Stars and Stripes waving just over his head, when,
his eyes lowering, they focused straight in a
fixed stare on Bart.</p>

<p>The colonel gave the young express agent an
awful look, and in an instant Bart knew that the
military man had been informed of the identity
of the audacious cannoneer of the evening
previous.</p>

<p>Like some orators, the colonel, once disturbed
by an extraneous contemplation, lost his voice,
cue and self-possession all in a second.</p>

<p>It seemed as if he could not take his eyes from
the innocent and embarrassed author of his distraction.</p>

<p>He spluttered, the rounded sentence on his
lips died down to measly insignificance, he stammered,
stumbled, and sat down with a red face,
his eyes darting rage at poor Bart.</p>

<p>Some of the boys in the crowd "caught on"
to the situation, and giggled and made significant
remarks, but the chairman on the platform covered
the colonel's confusion by announcing the
national anthem, and Bart effected his escape.</p>

<p>"He'll never forgive me, now," decided Bart.
"The damage to the statue was bad enough, but
breaking him up as my appearance did just now
is the limit. I hope Mr. Leslie doesn't hear of
my unfortunate escapade, and I hope the colonel
doesn't undertake to hurt my chances. He's an
irrational firebrand when he takes a dislike to
anybody, and Mrs. Harrington is worse."</p>

<p>Bart had a foundation for this double criticism.
The colonel was a pompous, self-important individual,
intensely selfish and domineering, and
his wife a thoughtless devotee of fashion and
society.</p>

<p>Mrs. Stirling did some very fine fancy work,
and a few months previous to the opening of
this tale the magnate's wife had asked as a favor
that she embroider some handkerchiefs as a wedding
present for a relative.</p>

<p>She never visited the Stirling house but she
left some sting or sneer of affected superiority
behind her, and when the work was done took it
home, and the next day sent a note complaining
that the handkerchiefs were spoiled, inclosing
about one-fifth the usual compensation for such
labor. But she did not return the handkerchiefs.</p>

<p>Mrs. Stirling later learned that their recipient
had expressed herself perfectly delighted with the
delicate, beautiful gift, but, being a true lady,
Bart's mother said nothing about the matter to
those who would have been glad to spread a
little gossip unfavorable to the dowdy society
queen of Pleasantville.</p>

<p>The village hardware store was open for the
sale of powder, and Bart stopped there on his
way back to the express office and purchased a
padlock, two keys fitting it, and some stout
staples and a hasp. He carried these articles
into the office when he reached it.</p>

<p>The thoughts of his father's plight, a haunting
dread that Colonel Harrington might make him
some trouble, and the uncertainty of continued
work in the express service, all combined to depress
his mind with anxiety and suspense, and he
tried to dismiss the themes by whistling a quiet,
soothing tune as he started to get the hammer to
put the padlock in place.</p>

<p>The minute he opened the door, however, the
whistle was instantly checked, and a quick glance
at the impromptu desk told Bart that the place had
welcomed a visitor since he had left it.</p>

<p>On a sheet of blank paper was scrawled the
words: "Express safe was locked last night&mdash;contents
all right."</p>

<p>And beside it was a heap of account books&mdash;the
entire records of the office, which Bart had supposed
were destroyed in the fire at the old express
shed the evening previous.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>THE YOUNG EXPRESS AGENT</h3>


<p>Our hero regarded the little pile of account
books as if they represented some long-lost, newly-found
treasure.</p>

<p>He was very much astonished at their presence
there. They were a tangible reality, however, and
no delusion of the senses, and his ready mind
took in the fact that someone had in an unaccountable
manner rescued them from the burning
express shed, and mysteriously restored them to
the proper representative of the express company
in the nature of a vast surprise.</p>

<p>The edges of one of the books was scorched,
which was the only evidence that they had been
in the flames.</p>

<p>They were all there, and Bart was very glad.
He now had in his possession every record of the
transactions of the Pleasantville express office
since the last New Year's day.</p>

<p>"And the contents of the safe are all right, too,
that writing says!" exclaimed Bart; "now what
does all this mean?"</p>

<p>The handwriting of the announcement was crude
and labored, and the boy felt sure he had never
seen it before.</p>

<p>He glanced with some excitement at the ruins
of the old express shed, then he went over there.
The embers had died down entirely, and the mass
of ashes and debris was sparkless and cold.</p>

<p>Bart went to a near railroad scrap heap and selected
a long iron rod crowbar crooked at the end.
He returned to the ruins and began poking the
debris aside. He was thus engaged when some
trackmen, lounging the day away over on a freight
platform, sauntered up to the spot.</p>

<p>"Why don't you work holidays, Stirling?"
asked one of them satirically.</p>

<p>"Somebody has got to work to get this mess
in shipshape order," retorted Bart. "The writing
said what was true!" he spoke to himself, as his
pokings cleared a broad iron surface. "The safe
door is shut."</p>

<p>The safe lay flat on its back where it had fallen
when the floor had burned away. It was an old-fashioned
affair with a simple combination attachment,
and so far as Bart could make out had suffered
no damage beyond having its coat of lacquer
and gilt lettering burned off.</p>

<p>He leaned over and felt of its surface, which
retained scarcely any heat now.</p>

<p>"We heard the old iron box was caught open
by the fire and everything in it burned up," spoke
one of the trackmen.</p>

<p>"I supposed so myself," said Bart, "but
it seems otherwise. I wonder how heavy
it is?"</p>

<p>"Wait till I get some tackle," said one of the
workmen.</p>

<p>He went away and returned with two crowbars
and a pulley and block tackle.</p>

<p>It was no work at all for those stout, experienced
fellows to get the safe clear of the ruins,
and, with the aid of a big truck they brought from
the freight house, convey it to the new express
quarters.</p>

<p>Just as the town bell rang out four o'clock, Mr.
Leslie stepped over the threshold.</p>

<p>He glanced about the place briskly, gave a
start as he noticed the heap of account books at
Bart's elbow, and looked both pleased and puzzled
as his eyes lighted on the safe.</p>

<p>"Why, Stirling!" he exclaimed, "are you a
wizard?"</p>

<p>"Not quite," replied Bart with a smile, "but
someone else seems to be."</p>

<p>"Are those the office books we thought burned
up, and the safe?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"How is this?"</p>

<p>Bart told of the mysterious return of the books
and of the scrap of writing that had led him to
dig up the safe.</p>

<p>"That's a pretty strange circumstance," observed
Mr. Leslie thoughtfully. "How do you
account for it?"</p>

<p>"I can't," admitted Bart, "except to theorize,
of course, that someone had enough interest in
myself or the company to rush into the burning
shed and save the books and close the safe while
I was getting my father to safety."</p>

<p>"That's rational, but who was it?" persisted
Mr. Leslie.</p>

<p>"Whoever it was," said Bart, "he has certainly
proved himself a good, true friend."</p>

<p>"Have you no idea who it is?" challenged Mr.
Leslie sharply.</p>

<p>Bart hesitated for a moment.</p>

<p>"Why, yes," he admitted finally. "I am pretty
sure who it is. I do not know his name, but I
have seen him several times," and Bart thought it
best to reveal to his superior all he knew about the
roustabout who had warned him of the burglary,
who had assisted him in rescuing his father from
the burning express shed, and who had vanished
suddenly as people began to crowd to the scene of
the blaze.</p>

<p>"I would like to meet that man!" commented
Mr. Leslie.</p>

<p>"I hardly think that possible," explained Bart.
"He seems to be afraid to face the open daylight,
and, as you see, has not even manifested himself
to me, except in a covert way."</p>

<p>"He is some poor unfortunate in trouble," said
the superintendent. "If you do see him, Stirling,
give him that&mdash;from the express company."</p>

<p>Bart was sure that his mysterious friend could
be no other than the roustabout. He took the
crisp ten-dollar bill, which the superintendent extended
with an impetuousness that showed he
was a genuine, warm-hearted man under the
surface.</p>

<p>"That quarter of a dollar you gave him was a
grand investment, Stirling. And now to get down
to business, for I haven't much time to spare."</p>

<p>The superintendent, seating himself on the
bench, consulted his watch and fixed his glance on
Bart in his former stern, practical way.</p>

<p>"I saw your father at the hospital," he announced.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir?" murmured Bart anxiously.</p>

<p>"They are going to let him go home to-morrow.
I am very sorry for his misfortune. He is an old
and reliable employee of the express company, and
we will find it difficult to replace him. I have
thought over a suggestion he made, and have decided
to offer you his position."</p>

<p>"Oh, sir! I thank you," said Bart spontaneously,
and the tears of gladness and pride sprang
to his eyes uncontrollably.</p>

<p>"Technically your father will appear in our
service. I do not think the company bonding
him will refuse to continue to be his surety. You
must make your own arrangement as to legally
representing him, signing his name and the like,
and of course you will have to do all the work,
for he will be helpless for some time to come.
Are you willing to undertake the responsibility?"</p>

<p>"Gladly."</p>

<p>"Then that is settled. This arrangement will
be in force for sixty days. If, at the end of that
time your father is no better, I do not doubt that
we will give you the regular appointment, if in
the meantime you fill the bill acceptably."</p>

<p>"I shall do my best."</p>

<p>"And I believe you will succeed. I like you,
Stirling," said Mr. Leslie frankly, "and I am
greatly pleased at the way you have stood in the
breach at a critical time, and protected the company's
interests. You will continue to draw fifty-five
dollars a month, and use your judgment
in incurring any expense necessary to keep things
running smoothly until we get a new express office
built. What is in the safe?"</p>

<p>Bart was familiar with its contents. He itemized
them, including some fifty unclaimed parcels
of small bulk that had accumulated during the
year.</p>

<p>"Get rid of all that stuff," ordered the superintendent
briskly. "I shall advise all the small
offices in this division to ship in all their uncalled-for
matter. Advertise a sale, make your returns
to the company, and start with a new sheet.
I think that is all there is any need of discussing
at present, but I will send instructions by wire or
mail as the occasion comes up. Count me your
friend as long as you show the true manhood you
have displayed to-day in a situation that would
have rattled and frightened most boys&mdash;and grown
men, too. Good-by."</p>

<p>He was keen, practical business to the core,
and no sentiment about him, for he arose promptly
with the farewell words, shook hands with Bart in
an off-hand way, and was gone like a flash to catch
his train to the city.</p>

<p>Bart stood for a moment in a kind of daze.
The congratulatory words of the superintendent,
and the appointment to the position of agent,
stirred the dearest desires of his heart.</p>

<p>His great good fortune momentarily overwhelmed
him, and he stood staring silently after
the superintendent in a grand dream of opulence
and ambition.</p>

<p>"I want you!" spoke a harsh, sudden voice,
and Bart Stirling came out of dreamland with a
shock.</p>

<h3>COLONEL JEPTHA HARRINGTON</h3>


<p>The young express agent recognized the tones
before he saw the speaker's face. Only one person
in Pleasantville had that mixture of lofty command
and tragic emphasis, and that was Colonel
Jeptha Harrington.</p>

<p>As Bart turned, he saw the village magnate ten
feet away, planted like a rock, and extending his
big golden-headed cane as if it was a spear and he
was poising to immediately impale a victim. The
colonel's brow was a veritable thundercloud.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," announced Bart promptly&mdash;"what
can I do for you?"</p>

<p>Bart did not get excited in the least. He looked
so cool and collected that the colonel ground his
teeth, stamped his foot and advanced swinging his
cane alarmingly.</p>

<p>"I've come to see you&mdash;" he began, and choked
on the words.</p>

<p>"May I ask what for?" interrogated Bart.</p>

<p>Colonel Harrington shook, as he placed his
cane under his arm and took out his big plethoric
wallet.</p>

<p>He selected a strip of paper and held it between
his forefinger and thumb.</p>

<p>"Young man," he observed, "do you know
what that is?"</p>

<p>Bart shook his head.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll tell you, it's a bill, do you hear? a
bill. It's for eighty-five dollars, damage done maliciously
on my private grounds, yesterday evening.
It represents the bare cost of a new copper
pedestal to replace the one you shot to pieces last
night, and it's a wonder you are not in jail for murder,
for had that cannon ball struck a human being&mdash;Enough!
before I take up this outrage with
the district attorney in its criminal phase, are
you going to settle the damage, or are you
not?"</p>

<p>"Colonel Harrington, I haven't got eighty-five
dollars."</p>

<p>"Then get it!" snapped the Colonel.</p>

<p>"Nor can I get it."</p>

<p>"Then," observed the colonel, restoring the bit
of paper to his pocket&mdash;"go to jail!"</p>

<p>Bart regarded his enemy dumbly. Colonel
Harrington was a power in Pleasantville, his will
and his way were paramount there.</p>

<p>"I am sorry," said Bart finally, in a tone of
genuine distress, "but eighty-five dollars is a sheer
impossibility&mdash;in cash. If you would listen to
me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I shan't!"</p>

<p>"I would like to offer payment or replace the
pedestal on reasonable terms."</p>

<p>"It don't go!"</p>

<p>"And, further, I am not to blame in the
matter."</p>

<p>"What!" roared the colonel "what's that?"</p>

<p>"It's the truth," asserted Bart. "I never
knew the cannon was loaded with a ball."</p>

<p>"Do you know who loaded it?"</p>

<p>Bart was silent.</p>

<p>"You won't tell? We'll see if a jury can't
make you, then!" fumed the colonel. "Aha!
it's serious now, is it? Not so much fun breaking
up my home and breaking up my speech at
the grove to-day, hey?"</p>

<p>Bart saw very plainly that what rankled most
with his volcanic visitor was the blow to his pride
he had suffered that afternoon at the grove.</p>

<p>"You put me in a nice fix, didn't you?"
cried the colonel&mdash;"laughing stock of the community!
Young man, you're on the downward
road, fast. You're all of a brood. Your
mother&mdash;"</p>

<p>Bart started forward with a dangerous sparkle
in his eye.</p>

<p>"Colonel Harrington," he said decisively,
"my mother has nothing to do with this affair."</p>

<p>"She has!" vociferated the magnate, "or
rather, her teachings. You're full of infernal
pride and presumption, the whole kit of you!"</p>

<p>"We have our rights."</p>

<p>"I'm a stockholder in the B. &amp; M., and I
fancy my influence will reach the express service.
You'll stay in your present job just long
enough for me to advise your employers of your
true character."</p>

<p>Bart was dismayed&mdash;that threat touched him
to the quick. He had felt very glad that Mr.
Leslie had not met the irate colonel. The mean-spirited
magnate noted instantly the effect of his
threat.</p>

<p>"You'll insult and defy me, will you?" he cried,
with a gloating chuckle. "Very well&mdash;you take
your medicine, that's all."</p>

<p>Bart could hardly control his voice, but he
said simply:</p>

<p>"Colonel Harrington, my father has been
blinded at his post of duty. I am the sole support
of the family. I hope you will pause and
consider before you plunge us into new trouble
and distress that we do not deserve. I have
never had the remotest thought of injuring you
or your property in any way. I am willing to
make all the amends I am able for the accidental
damage to your property, but I can't and won't
cringe to your injustice, nor grovel at your feet."</p>

<p>"Eighty-five dollars&mdash;one, the name of the
person who loaded that cannon&mdash;two, C.O.D.
before ten o'clock to-morrow morning, or I'll
sweep you off the map!" shouted the colonel.</p>

<p>He marched off, puffing up as his vain senses
were tickled with the fancy that he was a born
orator, and had just given utterance to some profoundly
apt and clever sentiments. Bart stared
after him in sheer dismay.</p>

<p>"It's a bad outlook," he murmured, "but&mdash;I
have tried to do my duty. I would like to have
money and influence, but would rather be plain
Bart Stirling than that man. He is coming
back."</p>

<p>Bart thought this, for, just about to round the
end of a dead freight and cross to the public
street, his late visitor turned abruptly.</p>

<p>He did not, however, retrace his steps. Instead,
he came to the strangest rigid pose Bart
had ever seen a human being assume.</p>

<p>He stood staring, spellbound, at the partly
open door of the nearest freight car. His cane
had fallen from his hand, his head was thrown up
as if he had been struck a stunning blow under
the chin, and even at the distance he was, Bart
could see that his usually red-puffed face was the
color of chalk. Almost immediately, through
the open doorway space of the freight car an arm
was protruded.</p>

<p>Its index finger was pointed, inflexible as an
iron rod, directly at the colonel. It fascinated
and transfixed the military man, and Bart Stirling,
staring also at the strange tableau, was overcome
with perplexity and mystification.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>QUEER COMRADES</h3>


<p>So many sensational occurrences had marked the
last twenty-four hours of Bart Stirling's career,
that it seemed as though the accumulating series
would never end.</p>

<p>It was a particularly ragged and miserable-looking
arm, and why it could so summarily check,
halt and hold the great magnate of Pleasantville,
was the problem that now tried Bart's reasoning
faculties.</p>

<p>Bart closed the door of the express office and
stepped out to where he could get a clearer view
of the colonel and his environment.</p>

<p>Suddenly the strain was removed. The colonel
threw up his arms with a gasp. He started to
turn around, clutched at his neck in a strangling
kind of a way, tottered, reeled, and plunged forward
on his face against a heap of cinders.</p>

<p>"This is serious," murmured Bart.</p>

<p>He rapidly covered the two hundred foot
space between the express shed and the freight
car.</p>

<p>"Colonel&mdash;Colonel Harrington!" he called
in some alarm, kneeling by the prostrate body of
his enemy.</p>

<p>Bart tried to pull him over on his back. As he
partially succeeded, he noticed that the colonel's
face was pitted, and in one or two places scratched
and bleeding from contact with the cinder particles.</p>

<p>The bulky form was quivering and convulsed.
The colonel had been dazed, it seemed, but not
rendered entirely unconscious, for now with a
groan he struggled to a sitting posture.</p>

<p>Bart drew out his handkerchief and tried to
clean the dirt from the military man's face.</p>

<p>The colonel resisted, he swayed and mumbled.
Then he groaned again as his eyes lit on the
freight car.</p>

<p>"Get me away from here," he moaned&mdash;"get
me away! What's happened to me?"</p>

<p>"That is what I was going to ask you," said
Bart. "Don't you know?"</p>

<p>The colonel passed his hand over his face and
mumbled, but made no coherent reply.</p>

<p>Bart glanced at the freight car. It afforded no
evidence of present occupancy. He reflected for
moment.</p>

<p>"Wait for just two minutes," he directed.</p>

<p>Running over to the drug store on the next
street, he spoke a few words to the man in charge,
and darted out again as the druggist hurried to
his telephone to call up the livery stable.</p>

<p>When he got back to the colonel, Bart found
the latter sitting propped up against the cinder
heap, his eyes open, and breathing heavily, but
still in a helpless kind of a daze.</p>

<p>He worked over the colonel, and finally got the
man on his feet. His position was so unsteady,
however, that he had to support him with one hand
while he dusted off his clothes with the other.</p>

<p>As he stood trying to keep his charge on his
feet, a cab rushed across the tracks. Its driver,
bluff Bill Carey, nodded familiarly to Bart, and
looked the colonel over critically. He got the
latter into the cab in an experienced way.</p>

<p>"Same old complaint!" he intimated to Bart
with a wink. "Drinks pretty heavily."</p>

<p>Bart leaned over into the cab.</p>

<p>"Colonel Harrington," he said, "do you wish
to be driven home?"</p>

<p>The colonel gave him a fishy stare, groaned
and put out a wavering hand.</p>

<p>"Come," he mumbled.</p>

<p>"Jump in," directed Carey. "You'll be useful
explaining the 'fall' up at the house!"</p>

<p>As they went on their way, the young express
agent experienced a striking sensation.</p>

<p>A topsy-turvy day of excitement was ending
with the peculiar combination of his riding in the
same carriage with his most bitter enemy, and
acting the good Samaritan.</p>

<p>They proceeded slowly, or rather cautiously,
for the popping and banging had recommenced
all over town.</p>

<p>Carey had to keep the spirited horses in strong
check as they passed groups of boys, reckless of
the quantity of firecrackers they deliberately fired
off as the team neared them.</p>

<p>Suddenly the horses were pulled to their
haunches with a vociferous shout. The cab
swerved and creaked, and the horses' hoofs beat
an alarming tattoo on the cobblestones.</p>

<p>"Whoa! whoa!" yelled Bill Carey. "You
young villains! get that infernal machine out of
the way. Can't you see&mdash;"</p>

<p>Bart stuck his head out of the cab window to
view an animated scene.</p>

<p>A fourteen-inch cannon cracker was hissing
and spitting out smoke barely two feet ahead
of the terrified horses in the middle of the
street.</p>

<p>At that moment it exploded. The horses gave
a wild snort, a frightened jerk at the reins.</p>

<p>Bart saw the staunch driver dragged from his
seat. He lit on his feet, braced, but was pulled
over, as, with a fierce tug, the horses snapped
the line in two.</p>

<p>Then, unrestrained, the team shot down the
street without guide or hindrance and with the
speed of the wind.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>"FORGET IT!"</h3>


<p>The young express agent acted quickly. A
single glance told him that the driver of the cab
could do nothing.</p>

<p>The frightened horses were speeding ahead at a
furious rate, could not be overtaken, and Bart
doubted if anyone could stop them.</p>

<p>No one tried, but all got out of the way promptly
as the team went tearing along. The horses came
to a crossing, and, terrified anew at a spitting
"Vesuvius" ahead, abruptly veered and turned
down a side lane.</p>

<p>It was at this moment that Bart threw open
the door of the cab, grasped a handle at the side
of the vehicle, and drew himself up to the
driver's seat.</p>

<p>The swing the horses made just then sent his
feet flying out in a wild circle, but he held on, and
the rebound landed him on the seat.</p>

<p>Our hero cast a quick look within the vehicle.
The colonel had "rousted" up somewhat. Buffeted
from side to side by the erratic and violent
movements of the horses, he was trying to maintain
his balance by frantically clinging with both
hands to the cushion under him.</p>

<p>As a wheel struck a stone the jar drove him forward.
His head smashed out the front glass, and
he uttered a yell of fear.</p>

<p>"Don't stir&mdash;don't jump!" shouted Bart
through the opening thus made.</p>

<p>"We'll be killed!" cried the man.</p>

<p>"No, we won't. Do as I say. I'm on deck,
and I'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>Bart sized up the situation, counted its risks
and possibilities, and described a sudden forward
leap.</p>

<p>The lines were torn and trailing under the
horses' feet. He cut the air in a reckless, but
well planned dive.</p>

<p>Bart landed sprawling between the two horses,
his knee striking the carriage pole.</p>

<p>Bracing himself there, he caught out at the
head of either horse. With a firm grip his fingers
closed on the bridle reins.</p>

<p>Ahead was a stony wagon track lining a deep
gravel pit dangerously near its edge.</p>

<p>About a hundred feet further on ran the creek,
sunk between banks some fifteen feet high.</p>

<p>Bart drew the bridles taut. He feared the tremendous
strain would break them. The heads
of the horses were now held as in a vice, but they
snorted and continued to plunge forward with undiminished
speed.</p>

<p>As a wheel landed in a rut full of thick mud,
their pace was momentarily retarded. Bart jerked
at the bridles. The horses paused fully, but
pranced and backed.</p>

<p>"Jump&mdash;crawl out&mdash;quick, now!" shouted
Bart breathlessly to the occupant of the cab.</p>

<p>The colonel had been bouncing around, groaning
and yelling ever since he had awakened to a
realization of his desperate plight.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute!" he puffed. "Gently! Wait
till I get out. Then you can go on," was his
remarkable concession.</p>

<p>Bart saw the bulky body of the magnate fall,
rather than step from the vehicle. He landed
clumsily at the side of the road, rolled up like a
ball, but unhurt.</p>

<p>He was so near to the grinding wheels of the
vehicle and kicking hoofs of the horses that Bart
relaxed the bridles.</p>

<p>Instantly the horses sprang forward again, but,
once clear of the colonel's prostrate body, Bart
focused his strength on a final mastery of the
maddened steeds.</p>

<p>He drew the bridles at a sharp, taut slant that
must have cut their mouths fearfully at the tenderest
part, for they fairly screamed with pain
and terror.</p>

<p>He succeeded in facing them sideways, ran
their heads into some brush, vaulted over them,
and, landing safely on his feet in front of them,
grabbed them near the bits and held them snorting
and trembling at a standstill.</p>

<p>Then he unshipped one of the lines and tied it
around a sapling, stroked the horse's heads, and
succeeded in quieting them down.</p>

<p>Going back to the road, he discerned Colonel
Harrington sitting up rubbing his head and
staring about abstractedly.</p>

<p>Farther away was a flying excited figure. Bart
recognized the disenthroned cabman. They met
where the colonel sat.</p>

<p>"All gone to smash, I suppose!" hailed Carey.</p>

<p>"No, a window broken, wheels scraped a
little&mdash;nothing worse," reported Bart.</p>

<p>"Where is the team?" panted Carey.</p>

<p>Bart pointed and explained, and the cabman
forged ahead with a gratified snort.</p>

<p>"You stuck till you landed 'em," applauded
Carey. "Stirling, you're nerve all through!"</p>

<p>Bart went up to Colonel Harrington and the
latter got on his feet. Bart could see that either
the druggist's potion or his succeeding violent
experience had quite restored the magnate to
his original self. He nursed a slight abrasion on
his chin, looked at Bart sheepishly, and then
stepped over to a big bowlder and rested against it.</p>

<p>"Are you feeling all right now, Colonel Harrington?"
asked Bart courteously.</p>

<p>"Me? Now? Ah yes! Quite&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;thank
you."</p>

<p>Bart was somewhat astonished at the words
and manner of his whilom enemy.</p>

<p>Colonel Harrington looked positively embarrassed.
He would glance at Bart, start to speak,
lower his eyes, and, turning pale as he seemed to
remember, and turning red as he seemed to realize,
would fumble at his watch fob, run his fingers
through his hair and act flustered generally.</p>

<p>"The cab will be back in a few minutes," remarked
Bart. "It was a pretty bad shaking up,
but I hope you are none the worse for it. Good
day, Colonel Harrington."</p>

<p>Bart turned to leave. He heard the colonel
spluttering.</p>

<p>"Hold on," ordered the magnate. "I want
to give you&mdash;I want to give you&mdash;some money,"
he observed.</p>

<p>"I can't take it, Colonel Harrington," said
Bart definitely.  "If I have been of service
to you I am glad, but you will remember I was
in the same danger as yourself, and quite anxious
to save my own skin."</p>

<p>"Bosh! I mean&mdash;maybe," retorted the colonel,
getting bombastic, and then humble.</p>

<p>"Well, put up your money, Colonel," advised
Bart. "As I say, if I have been of service to
you I am glad."</p>

<p>"You hold on!" ordered Colonel Harrington,
as Bart again moved to leave the spot.</p>

<p>The speaker poked in his wallet and brought
out a strip of paper, which Bart recognized as the
one he had so menacingly waved in his face an
hour previous at the express shed.</p>

<p>Colonel Harrington again poked about in his
pockets till he found a pencil. With somewhat
unsteady fingers he inscribed his name at the
bottom of the paper, and handed it to Bart.</p>

<p>"You take that," he directed.</p>

<p>"Why, this is a receipted bill for the damage
done to your statue," said Bart.</p>

<p>"Eighty-five dollars&mdash;just so."</p>

<p>"But I haven't paid it!"</p>

<p>"You needn't. Serious mistake&mdash;I see that,"
said the colonel. "That is, I see it now. Satisified
you didn't mean any harm. Sick of whole
muddle. And about getting you discharged and
all that rot&mdash;didn't mean it. Forget it! Was a
little mad and excited; see!"</p>

<p>"I can't take your receipt for what I haven't
paid, and what I am willing to pay as fast as I can,"
said Bart.</p>

<p>"Then tear it up&mdash;I won't take a cent!" declared
Colonel Harrington obstinately.</p>

<p>"The cab is coming," remarked Bart. "Shall
Mr. Carey drive you home?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose so. Come here, quick!"</p>

<p>He grabbed Bart's arm and drew our hero close
up to him, as though he had some pressing intelligence
to impart before the cab interrupted.</p>

<p>"Forget it!" he whispered hoarsely.</p>

<p>"About the statue&mdash;I'll be glad to," said Bart
frankly.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no, the&mdash;the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Runaway? I shall not mention it, Colonel
Harrington."</p>

<p>The colonel released Bart's arm, but with a
desperate groan. It was evident he was not fully
satisfied.</p>

<p>"Sure you'll forget It!" he persisted, very much
perturbed. "I don't mean my abusing you, or
the runaway, or&mdash;or&mdash;I mean I had an accident
after I left you at the express office. Someone
hailed me&mdash;but you know, you know!"</p>

<p>The colonel cast a penetrating look on Bart,
who shook his head negatively.</p>

<p>"I don't know, Colonel," he declared.</p>

<p>"Oh, come, now!" croaked the colonel, making
a ghastly attempt to give the statement the aspect
of a joke. Honest, you didn't hear anyone
call to me?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Bart.</p>

<p>The cab drove up and halted.</p>

<p>"Don't do any talking. Don't start any gossip
about&mdash;about&mdash;of course you won't! I've
got your word. You're a truthful, reliable boy,
Stirling, and I&mdash;I respect you," stumbled on the
colonel. "Mum's the word, and I'll&mdash;I'll make
you no trouble, see?"</p>

<p>"Thank you, Colonel Harrington," said Bart
in a queer tone.</p>

<p>The colonel again regarded him penetratingly,
and then got into the cab. He took the trouble of
leaning out and waving his hand as the vehicle
started up. He smiled in a sickly way at Bart,
and once made a movement as if inclined to get
out and once more suggest to the young express
agent that he "forget it."</p>

<p>"That man is scared half to death over something,"
reflected Bart, as he took a short cut to
regain the express office.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>THE MYSTERIOUS MR. BAKER</h3>


<p>The little express office looked good to Bart
as its precincts again sheltered him.</p>

<p>Things appeared better and clearer to him now
than at any time during the past twenty-four
hours, and his heart warmed up as he put his papers
and books in order, saw that the safe was secured,
and decided to close up business for the
day.</p>

<p>Doctor Griscom from the hospital had dropped
in for a few moments, and brought some news
that lifted something of a cloud from the heart of
the young express agent.</p>

<p>"I do not want to hold out any false hopes,"
he told Bart, "but there is a bare possibility that
your father may not become totally blind."</p>

<p>"That is blessed news!" cried Bart fervently.</p>

<p>"It is all a question of time, and after that of
skill," continued the surgeon. "Your father
must have absolute rest and cheerful, comfortable
surroundings; above all, peace of mind. I shall
watch his case, and when I see the first indication
of the services of some skilled specialist being of
benefit to him I will tell you. It will cost you
some money, but I will do all I can to make the
expert reasonable in his charges."</p>

<p>"Don't think of that," said Bart impetuously.
"With such a hope in view I am willing to work
my finger ends off!"</p>

<p>Bart was, therefore, in high spirits as he left
the express office, padlocking the door securely.</p>

<p>He was anxious to get home and then to the
hospital, to impart to his mother and father in turn
the assurance that they had a bread-winner able to
work and glad to do so for their benefit.</p>

<p>Amid the buoyancy of the relief from the continuous
strain and troubles of the day, Bart was
bent on a quick dash for home when he remembered
something that changed his plan.</p>

<p>"The roustabout, the poor fellow that I've got
the ten dollars for, the good fellow, if I don't mistake,
who saved the books and the contents of the
safe!" exclaimed Bart. "Actually, I had forgotten
all about him for the moment."</p>

<p>Bart stood still thinking, looking around speculatively,
his fingers mechanically touching the bank
note in his pocket which Mr. Leslie had given
him in trust.</p>

<p>He did not reflect long. He went at once to
the freight car whence he had seen the ragged arm
extended two hours previous, and looked in.</p>

<p>Back at one end were some broken grapevine
crates, and it was dim and shadowy there, so he
called out.</p>

<p>"Any one here?"</p>

<p>"Yes," came from the corner, and there was a
rustling of straw.</p>

<p>"I guess I know who," said Bart. "Come out
of that, my good friend, and show yourself," he
continued heartily.</p>

<p>"What for?" propounded a gloomy, wavering
voice.</p>

<p>"What for? that's good!" cried Bart. "Oh,
I know who you are, if I don't know your
name."</p>

<p>"Baker will do."</p>

<p>"All right, Mr. Baker, friend Baker, you're
true blue and the best friend I ever had, and I
want to shake hands with you, and slap you on
the back, and&mdash;help you."</p>

<p>A timid, muffled figure shifted into full outline,
but not into clear view, against the side of the car.</p>

<p>Bart took a step nearer. He promptly caught
at one hand of the slouching figure. Then he regarded
it in perplexity.</p>

<p>The roustabout held with his other hand a canvas
bag on his head so that it concealed nearly his
entire face.</p>

<p>"Why!" said Bart, reaching suddenly up and
momentarily pulling the impromptu hood aside.
"What's the matter now? Where is your beard
and long head of hair?"</p>

<p>"Burned."</p>

<p>"False?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then you were disguised?"</p>

<p>"I tried to be," was responded faintly.</p>

<p>Bart stood for a moment or two queerly regarding
the roustabout.</p>

<p>"Mr. Baker," he said finally, "I am bound to
respect any wish you may suggest, but I declare
I can't understand you."</p>

<p>"Don't try to," advised the roustabout in a
dreary way. "I'm not worth it."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you are."</p>

<p>"And it wouldn't do any good."</p>

<p>"It might. It must!" declared Bart staunchly,
"See here, I want to ask you a few questions
and then I want to give you some advice, or
rather tender my very friendly services. Do
you know what you have done for me to-day?"</p>

<p>"No. If I have done anything to help you
I am glad of it. You have been a friend to
me&mdash;the only friend I've found."</p>

<p>"I'll be a better one&mdash;that is, if you will let
me," pledged Bart warmly. "You warned me
about the burglars last night; you helped me
save my father's life."</p>

<p>"Anybody would do what I have done."</p>

<p>"No one did but yourself, just the same.
Don't be cynical&mdash;you're something of a hero, if
you only knew it. It was you who went into
the burning express shed and saved the account
books and closed the safe door."</p>

<p>"Who says so?" muttered Baker.</p>

<p>"I say so, and you know it&mdash;don't you?"</p>

<p>Baker made no response.</p>

<p>"Do you know what all this means for me
and my family?" went on Bart. "You have
done for me something I can never pay you for,
something I can never forget. You are true
blue, Mr. Baker! That's the kind of a worthless
good-for-nothing person you are, and I want
to call you my friend! Hello, now what is the
matter?"</p>

<p>The matter was that the roustabout was crying
softly like a baby. Bart was infinitely
touched.</p>

<p>"I don't know your secrets," continued Bart
earnestly, "and I certainly shall not pry into
them without your permission, but I want to repay
your kindness in some way. I can't rest till
I do. All I can do is to guess out that you are
in some trouble, maybe hiding. Well, let me
share your troubles, let me hide you in a more comfortable
way than lounging around cold freight cars
with half enough to eat. You've done something
grand in the last twenty-four hours&mdash;don't lose
sight of that in mourning over your sins, if you
have any, or in running away from some shadow
that scares you. I'm not the only one who thinks
you're a hero, either. There's someone else."</p>

<p>"Is there?" murmured the roustabout weakly.</p>

<p>"There is. It is Mr. Leslie, the express
superintendent. I told him about you. He left
this ten dollars for you, and the way he did
it ought to make you proud."</p>

<p>Bart forced the bank note into Baker's hand.
The man was shaking like a leaf from emotion.
He stood like one spellbound, unable
to take in all at once the good that was said
of him and done him.</p>

<p>"Come," rallied Bart, giving him a ringing
slap on the shoulder, "brace up and be what
you have proved yourself to be&mdash;a man!"</p>

<p>Baker started electrically. His tones showed
some force as he said:</p>

<p>"All right&mdash;you've made me feel good. But
you don't know a whole lot, and I can't tell you.
You say you're my friend."</p>

<p>"You believe that I am, do you not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do, and that's why I don't want
to drag you into any complications. This ten
dollars is mine, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"Will you spend it for me?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I want you to give me a pencil and some paper,
and I will write out a list of some things I
want. You take it and the ten dollars and bring
me the things here to-morrow. I want you to
promise in the meantime, though, that if you
come upon me unawares, or when I'm asleep, or
under any circumstances whatever, you will turn
your head away and not look at my face."</p>

<p>Bart was very much puzzled.</p>

<p>"I think I see how it is," he said after a brief
period of reflection, "you are afraid of being recognized?"</p>

<p>"Think that if you want to, maybe you're
right," returned Baker. "Anyway, I don't want
to do anything or have you do anything that will
mix you up in my troubles. My way is the safe
way. Will you do what I ask?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Bart promptly. "Can't I get
the things you want to-night?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid not, for most of the stores are
closed."</p>

<p>"That's right. Well, then, let me make a
suggestion: I have two keys to the new express
office. I'll give you one. After dark, if you
don't want to do it in daylight, go over and unlock
the door. Pick out two or three dry-goods
boxes from the heap behind the shed, carry them
in and rig up any kind of private quarters you like
at the far corner of the shed. I'll see that nobody
disturbs you. In a couple of hours I will
bring you a blanket from the house and a nice
warm lunch, and you can be comfortable and safe.
I will relock the door on you, and if you want to
leave at any time you can unfasten a window and
get out."</p>

<p>Baker did not reply. Bart heard him mumbling
to himself as though debating the proposition
submitted to him.</p>

<p>"I don't want to make you a lot of trouble,"
he finally faltered out.</p>

<p>"Of course you don't, and won't," asserted
Bart&mdash;"you want to give me pleasure, though,
don't you? So you do as I suggest, and I'll
sleep a good deal sounder than if you didn't.
Here's the key. I will be over to the express
office about eight o'clock. Is it a bargain?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the strange man.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>"HIGHER STILL!"</h3>


<p>About eight o'clock that evening Bart came
down to the express office carrying a lunch basket
and a blanket, as he had promised his erratic
friend, Mr. Baker.</p>

<p>The young express agent had spent a busy day,
and the evening promised to continue to furnish
plenty for him to do.</p>

<p>He had the infinite pleasure of seeing his
mother's face brighten up magically, when he related
sufficient to her of the day's experience to
satisfy her that the revenue from the express business
was secure.</p>

<p>She had received some intimation of this from
her husband's lips an hour previous at the hospital,
and said that Mr. Stirling was feeling relieved and
hopeful over the visit of the express superintendent,
and the prospects of Bart succeeding to his
position.</p>

<p>Bart very much wished to visit his father
at once, but Mrs. Stirling said he had quieted
for the night, was in no pain or mental distress,
and it might not be wise to disturb him.</p>

<p>Bart told his mother something about the roustabout
and their friendly relations, and the bottle
of hot coffee, home-made biscuit sandwiches, and
half a pie were put up for Bart's pensioner with
willing and grateful care.</p>

<p>Bart also took a shade lantern with him, and
lighted it when he came to the express office. He
found the padlock loose.</p>

<p>He glanced over to the far dim end of the place.
Baker had built a regular cross-corner barricade of
packing boxes, man-high.</p>

<p>Bart set the lantern on the bench and approached
the roustabout's hide-out.</p>

<p>"Are you there, Mr. Baker?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Yes, I did just as you told me to do," came
the reply, but the speaker did not show himself.</p>

<p>"Well, here's a blanket. Can you make up a
comfortable bed?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I've got a broad board on a slant,
and plenty of room."</p>

<p>Bart lifted over the lunch basket.</p>

<p>"There you are!" he said briskly&mdash;"now enjoy
yourself, and don't take a single care about
anything. Have you made out that list of things
you want?"</p>

<p>"Yes, here it is," and Baker handed over a
piece of paper inclosing the ten-dollar bill.</p>

<p>"I'll attend to this promptly," said Bart.
"Supposing I look it over right here? There
may be some things you have noted down I want
to ask you about."</p>

<p>"Maybe you'd better," assented Baker.</p>

<p>Bart sat down near the lantern. The bit of paper
was covered with crude handwriting, the same
as that which had announced to him that afternoon
that the contents of the safe in the old express
shed ruins were safe.</p>

<p>The list was not a very long one, but it was not
easy to fill.</p>

<p>Baker gave the measurements of a very cheap
cotton suit and the size of a cap with a very
deep peak. He also notated a green eye-shade, a
pair of goggles, and the ingredients for making a
dark brown face stain.</p>

<p>In addition to this he wanted a dark gray hair
switch, and it was easy to discern that his main
idea was to prepare an elaborate disguise.</p>

<p>"All right," reported Bart, as he finished reading
the list. "I'll have the things here just as
early in the morning as I can get them. I'm going
to put out the lantern, but I will then hand it
over to you with some matches. It has got a
shade, and you can focus the rays so they will not
show outside. Here are a couple of magazines&mdash;I
brought them from the house."</p>

<p>"You're mighty kind," said the refugee.
"Hold on. I want to tell you something. Of
course you think I'm acting strange. Some day,
though, if things come out right, I'll explain to
you, and you will say I did just right. There's
another thing: you may think from my actions I
am some desperate character. I hope I may burn
up right in this shed to-night if I'm not telling
the truth when I say to you that I never touched
a dishonored penny, never harmed a soul, never
did a wrong thing knowingly."</p>

<p>"I have confidence in your word, Mr. Baker,"
said Bart simply.</p>

<p>"Thank you, I'll prove I deserve it yet," declared
the strange man.</p>

<p>There was a spell of silence. Finally Bart decided
to venture a question on a theme he was
very curious about.</p>

<p>"Do you know Colonel Jeptha Harrington?"
he asked suddenly.</p>

<p>"Hoo&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>He had startled Baker&mdash;his incoherent mutterings
persuaded Bart of this.</p>

<p>"Don't you want to tell?" continued Bart. "All
right, only it was you who waved an arm at him
from the freight car this afternoon, wasn't it, now?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes, it was," admitted Baker in a low
tone.</p>

<p>"And you said something to him."</p>

<p>"Yes, I did. See here, I heard him calling you
down and threatening you, for I slunk up to the
shed here to see what he was up to. I'm interested
in him, I am, and so are others. When
I got back in hiding I spoke out, I told him
something&mdash;something that made his crabbed old
soul wizen up, something that scared the daylights
out of him. He had a brother, once. He's
dead, now. I said something that made this old
rascal think his brother's ghost had come back to
earth to haunt him."</p>

<p>"How could you do that?" inquired Bart, very
much interested.</p>

<p>"Because I had certain knowledge. Don't
ask any further. It will all come out, some day&mdash;the
day I'm waiting and working for. You saw
how he was affected. Well, I threatened things
that laid him out flat if he dared to so much as
place a straw in your path."</p>

<p>"I understand, now," said Bart.</p>

<p>He waited for a minute or two, hoping Baker
would divulge something further, but he did not
do so, and Bart said good night, secured the padlock
on the outside, and left the place with a
parting cheery direction to his strange pensioner
to sleep soundly and rest well.</p>

<p>The little ones were in bed when Bart got home,
but his mother and the girls were sitting on the
porch. Pretty well tired out, Bart joined them,
and they all sat watching the last of the display of
fireworks over near the common.</p>

<p>"This has been a pretty dull Fourth for you,
Bart," said his mother sympathizingly.</p>

<p>"It has been a very busy Fourth, mother," returned
Bart cheerfully&mdash;"I might say a very
hopeful, happy Fourth. Except for the anxiety
about father, I think I should feel very grateful
and contented."</p>

<p>A graceful rocket parted the air at a distance,
followed by the delighted shouts of juvenile
spectators.</p>

<p>"Upward and onward," murmured Mrs. Stirling,
placing a tender, loving hand on Bart's
shoulder.</p>

<p>A second rocket went whizzing up. It raced
the other, outdistanced it, seemed bound for the
furthest heights, never swerving from a true,
straight line.</p>

<p>Then it broke grandly, sending a radiant glow
across the clear, serene sky.</p>

<p>"That's my motto," said Bart, a touch of intense
resolve in his tones&mdash;"higher still!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>MRS. HARRINGTON'S TRUNK</h3>


<p>"Hey, there! Stirling."</p>

<p>Bart was busy at his desk in the express office,
but turned quickly as he recognized the tones.</p>

<p>Trouble in the shape of Lem Wacker loomed
up at the doorway.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Bart.</p>

<p>It was a week after the Fourth, and in all that
time Bart had not seen anything of the man whom
he secretly believed was responsible for the fire
at the old express office.</p>

<p>"Who's the responsible party here?" demanded
Lem, making a great ado over consulting
a book he carried.</p>

<p>"I am."</p>

<p>"All right, then&mdash;I represent Martin &amp; Company,
pickle factory."</p>

<p>"Oh, you've found a job, have you," spoke
Bart, forced to smile at the bombastic business air
assumed by his visitor.</p>

<p>"I represent Martin &amp; Company," came from
Wacker, in a solemn, dignified way. "Inspector.
We want a rebate on that bill of lading."</p>

<p>Lem removed a slip from his loose-leaf book
and tendered it to Bart.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with it?" inquired Bart.</p>

<p>"Consignment short," announced Wacker.</p>

<p>Bart looked him squarely in the eyes. Wacker
had made the announcement malignantly. His
gaze dropped.</p>

<p>"I'm hired to stop the leaks," he mumbled,
"and if this office is responsible for any of them
I'm the man to find it out."</p>

<p>"Well, in the present instance your claim
is sheer folly. I see you note here one hundred
and fifty pounds shortage. What is your basis?"</p>

<p>"I weighed them myself."</p>

<p>Bart consulted his books. Then he turned
again to Wacker.</p>

<p>"This consignment was shipped as nine hundred
and fifty pounds," he said. "It weighed
that at the start."</p>

<p>"That's what the shipping agent says, yes."</p>

<p>"And you claim eight hundred pounds?"</p>

<p>"Exactly."</p>

<p>"It was weighed up here when received&mdash;nine
hundred and fifty pounds."</p>

<p>"Come off!" jeered Wacker. "Wasn't I an
express agent once and don't I know the ropes?
What receiving agent ever takes the trouble
to re-weigh!"</p>

<p>"My father did&mdash;I always do," announced
Bart flatly.</p>

<p>"Even if you did," persisted Wacker, "what
little one-horse agent dares to dispute the big
company's weight at the other end of the line?"</p>

<p>"Oh," observed Bart smoothly, "you think
there is a sort of collusion, do you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do&mdash;I am an expert!"</p>

<p>"Sorry to disturb the profundity of your calculations,
Mr. Wacker," said Bart quietly, "but
in the present instance there could not possibly
be any mistake. Our scales were burned up in
the fire. The new ones have not yet arrived,
and in the meantime, as a temporary accommodation,
our weighing is done up at the in-freight
platform by the official weigh master of the road.
I fancy Martin &amp; Company will accept that
verification as final. Don't you think so, Mr.
Wacker?"</p>

<p>Lem Wacker snatched the paper Bart returned
to him with a positive growl.</p>

<p>"I'll catch you Smart-Alecks yet!" he muttered
surlily.</p>

<p>"What are you so anxious to catch us for?"
inquired Bart coolly.</p>

<p>"Never you mind&mdash;I'll get you!"</p>

<p>Lem Wacker had said that before, and as he
backed away Bart dismissed him with a shrug of
his shoulders.</p>

<p>There were too many practical things occupying
his time to waste any on fancies. Bart had put in
a very busy week, and a very satisfactory one. He
had started in with a system, and had never
allowed it to lag. In fact, he improved it daily.</p>

<p>Thanks to his brief, but thorough apprenticeship
under his father's direction, he had acquired
a knowledge of all the ins and outs of the office
work proper.</p>

<p>He had shown great diligence in clearing up
the old business. In three days after taking official
charge Bart had forwarded to headquarters
all the claims covering the fire.</p>

<p>He had also listed the unclaimed packages in
the safe, together with those burned up, had followed
out Mr. Leslie's direction to collect all not-called-for
express matter at little stations in his
division, and was now awaiting an order from headquarters
as to their final disposition.</p>

<p>The strange "Mr. Baker" had drifted out of his
life, temporarily at least.</p>

<p>Bart had purchased the articles the roustabout
had required, and that evening Baker came out
from his hiding-place marvelously unlike the
great-bearded, shock-headed individual Bart had
previously known.</p>

<p>A green patch and goggles, a deep brown face-stain,
and a pair of thin artistically made "side-burns"
comprised a puzzling make-up.</p>

<p>Baker told Bart that he felt himself perfectly
disguised, that he could now venture freely down
the road a distance where he had business.</p>

<p>"I'll be back, though," he promised. "Perhaps
in two weeks. I'm not through with Pleasantville.
Oh, no! There's going to be an explosion
here some time soon. You've put me on
my feet, Stirling, and you won't be sorry when
you know what I'm after."</p>

<p>Bart had half planned to hire Baker for what extra
work he had to give out. He had to look about for
someone else, and Darry Haven and his brother,
Bob, alternately came around to the express office
before and after school, and helped Bart.</p>

<p>The company allowed for this extra service,
but Bart had to take a separate voucher for each
task done.</p>

<p>Colonel Harrington had left for a fashionable
resort two days after the Fourth, and Bart understood
that Mrs. Harrington was preparing to join
him there.</p>

<p>Bart's father had been taken home after spending
two days in the hospital.</p>

<p>The surgeon there had told him that his case
was not at all hopeless, and the old express agent
was cheerful and patient under his affliction, and
nights Bart made a great showing of the necessity
of going over the business of the day, so as to
keep his father's mind occupied.</p>

<p>So far Bart's affairs had settled down to what
seemed to be a clear and definite basis, and when
that afternoon a new platform scale arrived, and
he received a letter of instructions from Mr. Leslie
concerning the sale of the unclaimed express packages,
he felt a certain spice of pleasant anticipation
injected into the business routine.</p>

<p>"Why, it will be a regular circus!" said Darry
Haven that afternoon, when Bart told him about
it. "Last year they advertised the sale at Marion.
I was up there at my uncle's. All the farmers
came in for miles around, and the way they bid,
and the funny things they found in the packages,
made it jolly, I tell you!"</p>

<p>When Bart got through with the routine work
the next day, he started in to formulate his plans
for the sale.</p>

<p>It was to take place in thirty days, and the superintendent
had relied on Bart's judgment to
make it a success.</p>

<p>Darry Haven came in as Bart was laboring
over an advertisement for the four weekly papers
of Pleasantville and vicinity.</p>

<p>"Here," he said promptly, "you are of a literary
family. Suppose you take charge of this, and
get up the matter for a dodger, too."</p>

<p>"Say, Bart," said Darry eagerly, "we can print
the dodgers&mdash;my brother and I&mdash;as good as a
regular office. You know we've got a good
amateur outfit at home. Father was an editor,
and I'll get him to write up a first-class stunner
of an advertisement. Can't you throw the job
our way?"</p>

<p>"If you make the price right, of course," answered
Bart.</p>

<p>"We can afford to underbid them all," declared
Darry; and so the matter was settled.</p>

<p>"Oh, by the way," said Darry, as he was about
to leave&mdash;"Lem Wacker's out of a job again."</p>

<p>"You don't surprise me," remarked Bart, "but
how is that?"</p>

<p>"Why, Martin &amp; Company are buying green
peppers at seventy cents a bushel. They heard
that down at Arlington someone was offering them
to the storekeepers at one dollar for two bushels,
investigated, detected Dale Wacker peddling the
peppers from factory bags, and found that his uncle,
Lem, was mixed up in the affair. Anyway, Dale's
father had to settle the bill, and they fired Lem."</p>

<p>"Mr. Lem Wacker is bad enough when at
work," remarked Bart, "but out of work I fear he
is a dangerous man. All right!" he called, hurrying
to the door as there was a hail from outside.</p>

<p>Colonel Harrington's buckboard was backed to
the platform and its driver was unloading a large
trunk.</p>

<p>Bart helped carry it in, dumped it on the scales,
went to the desk, got the receipt book, and reading
the label on the trunk found that it was directed
to Mrs. Harrington at Cedar Springs, the summer
resort to which the colonel had already gone.</p>

<p>"Value?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Harrington didn't say, and I don't know.
If you saw all the finery in that trunk, though,
you'd stare. You see, Mrs. Harrington is going
to stay three weeks at the Springs, and is sending
on her finest and best. I'll bet they amount to a
couple of thousand dollars."</p>

<p>Bart filled out a blank receipt, stamping it:
"Value asked, and not given."</p>

<p>"It can't go till morning," he said.</p>

<p>"That don't matter. The missus won't be going
down to the Springs till Saturday."</p>

<p>"You have just missed the afternoon express,"
went on Bart.</p>

<p>"Yes, Lem Wacker said I would."</p>

<p>"What has he got to do with it?" asked Bart.</p>

<p>"Why, nothing, I gave him a lift down the
road, and he told me that."</p>

<p>The driver departed. Bart stood so long looking
ruminatively at the trunk that Darry Haven
finally nudged his arm.</p>

<p>"Hi! come out of it," he called. "What's
bothering you, Bart?"</p>

<p>"Nothing&mdash;I was just thinking."</p>

<p>"About that trunk, evidently, from the way you
stare at it."</p>

<p>"Exactly," confessed Bart. "I believe I am
getting superstitious about anything connected
with the Harringtons or the Wackers. Here,
give me a lift."</p>

<p>"All right. Where?"</p>

<p>"Swing it up&mdash;I want to get it on top of the
safe."</p>

<p>"What!" ejaculated Darry in profound amazement.</p>

<p>"Yes, we don't handle property in the thousands
every day in the week."</p>

<p>"But the company is responsible only up to
fifty dollars, when they don't pay excess."</p>

<p>"That doesn't satisfy the shipper if there is any
loss. I feel we ought to be extra careful until we
get a new office with proper safeguards, and that
expensive outfit staying here all night worries me.
Up&mdash;hoist!"</p>

<p>Bart settled the trunk on top of the safe, and on
top of that he set the lantern.</p>

<p>When he locked up for the night he lit the
lantern, and went over to the freight platform
where the night watchman had just come on
duty.</p>

<p>Bart knew him well and liked him, and the feeling
was reciprocal.</p>

<p>He explained that a valuable trunk had to remain
overnight in the express shed, and how he
had placed it.</p>

<p>"Just take a casual glance over there on your
rounds, will you, Mr. McCarthy?" he continued.</p>

<p>"I certainly will. You set the lantern so it
shows things inside, and I'll keep an eye open,"
acquiesced the watchman.</p>

<p>Bart went home feeling satisfied and relieved at
the arrangement he had made.</p>

<p>All the same he did not sleep well that night.
About daybreak he woke up with a sudden jump,
for he had dreamed that Colonel Harrington had
thrown him into a deep pit, and that Lem Wacker
was dropping Mrs. Harrington's precious trunk
on top of him.</p>

<h3>AN EARLY "CALL"</h3>


<p>The young express agent was conscious that he
shouted outright in his nightmare, for the trunk
he was dreaming about as it struck him seemed
to explode into a thousand pieces.</p>

<p>The echoes of the explosion appeared to still
ring in his ears, as he sat up and pulled himself
together. Then he discovered that it was a real
sound that had awakened him.</p>

<p>"Only five," he murmured, with a quick glance
at the alarm clock on the bureau&mdash;"and someone
at the front door!"</p>

<p>Rat, tat, tat! it was a sharp, distinct summons.</p>

<p>"Why," continued Bart briskly, jumping out
of bed and hurrying on some clothes, "it's Jeff!"</p>

<p>Jeff was "the caller" for the roundhouse. He
was a feature in the B. &amp; M. system, and for ten
years had pursued his present occupation.</p>

<p>"Something's up," ruminated Bart a little excitedly,
as he ran down the stairs and opened the
front door. "What is it, Jeff?"</p>

<p>"Wanted," announced the laconic caller.</p>

<p>"By whom?"</p>

<p>"McCarthy, down at the freight house."</p>

<p>"What's wrong?"</p>

<p>"He didn't tell&mdash;-just asked me to get you
there quick as your feet could carry you."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Jeff, I'll lose no time."</p>

<p>Bart hurried into his clothes. Clear of the
house, he ran all the way to the railroad yards.</p>

<p>As he rounded into them from Depot Street,
he came in sight of the express office.</p>

<p>McCarthy, the night watchman, was seated on
the platform looking down in a rueful way.</p>

<p>He got up as Bart approached, and the latter
noticed that he looked haggard, and swayed as
though his head was dizzy.</p>

<p>"What is it?" cried out Bart irrepressibly.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Stirling," said the watchman, "but&mdash;look
there!"</p>

<p>Bart could not restrain a sharp cry of concern.
The express office door stood open, and the padlock
and staples, torn from place, lay on the
platform. He rushed into the building. Then
his dismay was complete.</p>

<p>"The trunk!" he cried&mdash;"it's gone!"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is!" groaned McCarthy, pressing at
his heels.</p>

<p>Bart cast a reproachful look at the watchman.
The lantern, too, had disappeared. He sank to
the bench, overcome. Finally he inquired faintly:</p>

<p>"How did it happen?"</p>

<p>"I only know what happened to me," responded
the watchman. "I was drugged."</p>

<p>"When&mdash;where&mdash;by whom?"</p>

<p>"It's guesswork, that, but the fact stands&mdash;I
was dosed. You asked me to watch, and I did
watch. Up to midnight that lantern on top of
the trunk wasn't out of my sight fifteen minutes
at a time."</p>

<p>"And then?" questioned Bart.</p>

<p>"I always go over to the crossing switch
shanty about twelve o'clock to eat my lunch.
The old switchman lends me his night key.
I put my lunch in on the bench when I come on
duty, and he always leaves the stove full of
splinters to warm up the coffee quick. When I
let myself in at midnight, the lantern here was
right as a beacon&mdash;I particularly noticed it."</p>

<p>"How long was it before you came out again?"</p>

<p>"Four hours afterwards&mdash;just a little while ago."</p>

<p>"Then you&mdash;fell asleep?" said Bart.</p>

<p>"Yes, I did, and no blame to me. I'm no
skulker, as you well know. I never did such a
thing before in all my ten years of duty here. I
was doped."</p>

<p>"How do you know that?" asked Bart.</p>

<p>"I warmed up the coffee and had my lunch,"
narrated the watchman. "Then I settled down
for a ten minutes' comfortable smoke, as I always
do. I felt sort of sickish, right away. I had
noticed that the coffee tasted queer, but I fancied
it might have been burned. Anyhow, half an
hour ago I seemed to come out of a stupor, my
head fairly splitting, and my stomach burning as
though I'd taken poison. I thought of poison,
somehow, and more so than ever as I reached
over to see if there was any coffee left, for my
throat was dry as a piece of pine board. There
wasn't, but at the bottom of the pail were two or
three little sticky brown dabs. I tasted the stuff.
It was opium. I know, for I've used it in sickness.
I stumbled out to get the air. The minute
I glanced over at the express office I guessed
it all out. It's a burglary, right and proper, Stirling,
and the fellows who did it knew I was on
the watch, got into the switch shanty, fixed the
coffee and put me to sleep."</p>

<p>Bart rapidly turned over in his mind all that
the watchman had disclosed.</p>

<p>"See here," he said promptly, "how many
keys are there to the switch shanty?"</p>

<p>"Only one that I know anything of," responded
McCarthy. "There can't be many, or the old
switchman wouldn't have to lend me his key."</p>

<p>"Lem Wacker subbed for him once, didn't
he?" inquired Bart pointedly.</p>

<p>"Yes, for a day or two&mdash;say! you don't
think&mdash;" began the watchman, with a start of suspicion.</p>

<p>"I'm not thinking anything positive," interrupted
Bart&mdash;"I am only seeking information.
When Wacker subbed for the old switchman,
did he have a special key?"</p>

<p>"N&mdash;no," answered the watchman hesitatingly,
"for I remember Wacker loaned me the old switchman's
key the first night. Hold on, though!"
cried McCarthy with a spurt of memory, "it comes
back to me clear now. The next night he told
me to keep the key till the old switchman came
back on duty&mdash;so he must have had an extra one
of his own. They are easily got&mdash;it's a common,
ordinary lock."</p>

<p>Bart's lips shut close. He went outside, looked
keenly around, and jumped down from the platform.</p>

<p>The watchman trailed out after him, watching
him in a worried, discouraged way. There was
no doubting the word of a trusted employee like
McCarthy, and Bart realized that he felt very
badly over the matter.</p>

<p>"What is it, Stirling&mdash;have you found anything?"
asked the watchman eagerly, as Bart,
after inspecting the roadway, still more narrowly
regarded the edges of the platform boards, running
his finger over them in a critical way.</p>

<p>"Yes, I have," announced Bart&mdash;"that trunk
was taken away from here in a wagon."</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"Look at those fresh wheel tracks," directed
Bart, pointing to the road. "They sided a wagon
up to the platform, right here. So close, that a
wheel or the body of the wagon scraped along the
edges of the boards. The paint was fresh. And
it was bright red," added Bart.</p>

<p>"You're a good one to guess that out," muttered
the watchman. "Why, say&mdash;"</p>

<p>McCarthy gave a prodigious start and put his
hand up to his head, as if some idea had occurred
to him with tremendous force. "You mentioned
Lem Wacker. It's funny, but last week Wacker
bought a new wagon."</p>

<p>"Are you sure of that?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it was the same one that his scapegrace
nephew, Dale Wacker, was caught peddling the
stolen pickles in. I saw Lem painting it fresh
out in his shop only two days ago. You know I
live just beyond him."</p>

<p>"What color?"</p>

<p>"Red."</p>

<p>"Then Lem Wacker must know something
about this burglary!" declared Bart.</p>

<h3>AT FAULT</h3>


<p>"I am sorry," again said the night watchman,
after a long thoughtful silence on the part of Bart.</p>

<p>"I know you are, Mr. McCarthy," returned
Bart, "but nobody blames you.  I've got to get
back that trunk, though! you are positive about
Lem Wacker's wagon being newly painted?"</p>

<p>"Oh, sure."</p>

<p>"And red?"</p>

<p>"Yes, a bright red. Wacker lives near us, as
I said. I strolled down the alley day before yesterday.
I saw his shed doors open, and Wacker
putting on the paint. I remember even joking
him about his experience in painting the town the
same color once in awhile. He took that as a
compliment, Lem did. It seems he traded for
the wagon some time ago. He told me he was
going to start an express company of his own."</p>

<p>"He seems to have done it&mdash;so far as that
trunk is concerned!" murmured Bart. "Mr.
McCarthy, you and I are friends?"</p>

<p>"Good friends, Stirling."</p>

<p>"And I can talk pretty freely to you?"</p>

<p>"I see your drift&mdash;you think Lem Wacker had
a hand in this burglary?"</p>

<p>"I certainly do."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll say that I don't think he's beyond
it," observed the watchman. "You'll find,
though, he only had a hand in it. His way is
generally using someone else for a cat's-paw."</p>

<p>"I am going to ask you to do something for
me," resumed Bart seriously&mdash;"I'm going to get
back that trunk&mdash;I've got to get it back."</p>

<p>"The company ought to provide you with a
safe, decent building."</p>

<p>"That will come in time."</p>

<p>"No one can blame you. They can't expect
you to sit up watching all night, nor carrying
trunks to bed with you for safe-keeping."</p>

<p>"No, but the head office, while it might stand
an accidental fire, will not stand a big loss on top
of it. My ability to handle this express proposition
successfully is at stake and, besides that, I
would rather have almost anybody about my ears
than Mrs. Harrington."</p>

<p>"The colonel's wife is a Tartar, all right,"
bluntly declared the night watchman. "Hello!
here's somebody from Harrington's, now."</p>

<p>The same buckboard that had driven up the
afternoon previous, came dashing to the platform
as McCarthy spoke.</p>

<p>It was in charge of the same driver, who
promptly hailed Bart with the words:</p>

<p>"That trunk gone yet?"</p>

<p>"No, not yet," answered Bart.</p>

<p>"Then I'm in time. Mrs. Harrington wanted
to put something else in&mdash;this box. Forgot it,
yesterday," and the speaker fished up an oblong
package from the bottom of the wagon.</p>

<p>"It will have to go separate," explained Bart.</p>

<p>"Can't do that&mdash;it's a silk dress, and not
wrapped for any hard usage. Why, what's happened!"
pressed the colonel's man, shrewdly scanning
the disturbed countenances of Bart and the
watchman. "Door lock smashed, too, and&mdash;say!
I don't see the trunk!"</p>

<p>He had stepped to the platform and looked inside
the express shed.</p>

<p>Bart thought it best to explain, and did so. It
made him feel more crestfallen than ever to trace
in the way his auditor took it, that he anticipated
some pretty lively action when Mrs. Harrington
was apprised of her loss.</p>

<p>"You can tell Mrs. Harrington that everything
possible is being done to recover the trunk," Bart
told the man as he drove off. "Now then, Mr.
McCarthy," he continued, turning to his companion,
"I am going to ask you to take charge here
till I return. I will pay you a full day's wages,
even if you have to stay only an hour."</p>

<p>"You'll pay me nothing!" declared the watchman
vigorously. "I'll camp right in your service
as soon as the seven o'clock whistle blows, and
you get on the trail of that missing trunk."</p>

<p>"I intend to," said Bart. "I will get Darry
Haven to come down here. He knows the office
routine. In the meantime, we had better not say
much about the burglary."</p>

<p>"Are you going on a hunt for Lem Wacker?"</p>

<p>"I am."</p>

<p>Bart went first to the Haven home. He found
Darry Haven chopping wood, told him of the
burglary, and asked him to get down to the express
office as soon as he could.</p>

<p>"If you don't come back by nine o'clock, I will
arrange to stay all day," promised Darry.</p>

<p>Then Bart went to the house where Lem
Wacker lived. It was characteristic of its proprietor&mdash;ricketty,
disorderly, the yard unkept and
grown over with weeds.</p>

<p>Smoke was coming out of the chimney. Someone
was evidently astir within, but the shades were
down, and Bart stole around to the rear.</p>

<p>The shed doors were open, and the wagon
gone and the horse's stall vacant.</p>

<p>Bart went to the back door of the house and
knocked, and in a few minutes it was opened by
a thin-faced, slatternly-looking woman.</p>

<p>Bart knew who she was, and she apparently
knew him, though they had never spoken together
before. The woman's face looked interested,
and then worried.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Mrs. Wacker," said Bart,
courteously lifting his cap. "Could I see Mr.
Wacker for a moment?"</p>

<p>"He isn't at home."</p>

<p>"Oh! went away early? I suppose, though,
he will be back soon."</p>

<p>"No, he hasn't been home all night," responded
the woman in a dreary, listless tone.
"You work at the railroad, don't you? Have
they sent for Lem? He said he was expecting a
job there&mdash;we need it bad enough!"</p>

<p>She glanced dejectedly about the wretched
kitchen as she spoke, and Bart felt truly sorry for
her.</p>

<p>"I have no word of any work," announced
Bart, "but I wish to see Mr. Wacker very much
on private business." When did he leave home?</p>

<p>"Last night at ten o'clock."</p>

<p>"With his horse and wagon?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes," admitted the woman, with a sudden,
wondering glance at Bart. "How did you
know that?"</p>

<p>"I noticed the wagon wasn't in the shed."</p>

<p>"Oh, he sold it&mdash;and the horse."</p>

<p>"When, Mrs. Wacker?"</p>

<p>"Last night some men came here, two of
them, about nine o'clock. They talked a long
time in the sitting room, and then Lem went out
and hitched up. He came into the kitchen before
he went away, and told me he had a chance
to sell the rig, and was going to do it, and had to
go down to the Sharp Corner to treat the men
and close the bargain."</p>

<p>"I see," murmured Bart. "Who were the
men, Mrs. Wacker?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. One of them was here with
Lem about two weeks ago, but I don't know his
name, or where he lives. He don't belong
in Pleasantville. Oh, dear!" she concluded, with
a sigh of deep depression, "I wish Lem would
get back on the road in a steady job, instead of
scheming at this thing and that. He'll land us
all in the poorhouse yet, for he spends all he gets
down at the Corner."</p>

<p>Bart backed down the steps, feeling secretly
that Lem Wacker would have a hard time disproving
a connection with the burglary.</p>

<p>"Take care of the dog!" warned Mrs. Wacker
as she closed the door.</p>

<p>Bart, passing a battered dog-house, found it
tenantless, however.</p>

<p>"I wonder if Lem Wacker has sold the dog,
too?" he reflected. "Poor Mrs. Wacker! I
feel awfully sorry for her."</p>

<p>Bart walked rapidly back the way he had
come. It was just a quarter of seven when he
reached a half-street extending along and facing
the railroad tracks for a single square.</p>

<p>The Sharp Corner was a second-class groggery
and boarding house, patronized almost entirely
by the poorest and most shiftless class of trackmen.</p>

<p>Its proprietor was one Silas Green, once a
switchman, later a prize fighter, always a hard
drinker, and latterly so crippled with rheumatism
and liquor that he was just able to get about.</p>

<p>Bart went into the place to find its proprietor
just opening up for the day. The dead, tainted
air of the den made the young express agent
almost faint. As it vividly contrasted with the
sweet, garden scented atmosphere of home, he
wondered how men could make it their haunt,
and was sorry that even business had made it
necessary for him to enter the place.</p>

<p>"Mr. Green," he said, approaching the bar, "I
am looking for Lem Wacker. Can you tell me
where I may find him?"</p>

<p>"Eh? oh, young Stirling, isn't it? Wacker?
Why, yes, I know where he is."</p>

<p>He came out slowly from the obscurity of the
bar, blinking his faded eyes.</p>

<p>Bart knew he would not be unfriendly. His
father, one stormy night a few years previous, had
picked up Green half frozen to death in a snowdrift,
where he had fallen in a drunken stupor.</p>

<p>Every Christmas day since then, Green had
regularly sent a jug of liquor to his father, with
word by the messenger that it was for "the
squarest man in Pleasantville, who had saved his
life."</p>

<p>Mr. Stirling had set Bart a practical temperance
example by pouring the liquor into the
sink, but had not offended Green by declining
his well-meant offerings.</p>

<p>Bart remembered this, and felt that he might
appeal to Green to some purpose.</p>

<p>"Mr. Wacker is not at home," he explained,
"and I wish to find him. I understand he was
here last night."</p>

<p>"He was," assented Green. "Came here about
ten, and hasn't left the house since."</p>

<p>"Why!" ejaculated Bart&mdash;and paused abruptly.
"He is here now?"</p>

<p>"Asleep upstairs."</p>

<p>"And he has been here since&mdash;he is here now!"
questioned Bart incredulously.</p>

<p>"He was, ten minutes ago, when I came down&mdash;" asserted
Green.</p>

<p>Bart stood dumbfounded. He was at fault&mdash;the
thought flashed over his mind in an instant.</p>

<p>It would not be so easy as he had fancied to run
down the burglars, for if what Silas Green said was
true, Lem Wacker could prove a most conclusive
<i>alibi</i>.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h3>A FAINT CLEW</h3>


<p>"What's the trouble, Stirling?" inquired Silas
Green, as Bart stood silently thinking out the problem
set before him. "You seem sort of disappointed
to find Wacker here. If you didn't think
he was here, why did you come inquiring for him?"</p>

<p>"I knew he came here last night," said Bart.
"Mrs. Wacker told me so."</p>

<p>"Do you want to see him?"</p>

<p>"No, I think not," answered Bart after a moment's
reflection.</p>

<p>"Then is there anything else I can do for you,
or tell you? You seem troubled. They say I'm
a crabbed, treacherous old fellow. All the same,
I would do a good turn for Robert Stirling's
son!"</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Bart, feeling easier. "If
you will, you might tell me who was with Lem
Wacker last night."</p>

<p>"Two men&mdash;don't know them from Adam,
never saw them before. Lem drove up with
them in his rig about ten o'clock. They took
the horse and wagon around to the side shed and
came in, drank and talked a lot among themselves,
and finally started playing cards in the
little room yonder."</p>

<p>"By themselves?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Once, when I went in with refreshments,
Wacker was in a terrible temper. It
seemed he had lost all his money, and he had
staked his rig and lost that, too. One of the two
men laughed at him, and rallied him, remarking
he would have 'his share,' whatever that meant, in
a day or two, and then they would meet again and
give him his revenge. By the way, I'm off in
my story&mdash;Wacker did leave here, about eleven
o'clock."</p>

<p>"Alone?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He was gone half an hour, came back
looking wise and excited, joined his cronies again,
and at midnight was helpless. My man and
I carried him upstairs to bed."</p>

<p>"What became of the two men?"</p>

<p>"They sat watching the clock till closing
time, one o'clock, went out, unhitched the horse,
and drove off."</p>

<p>"I wish I knew who they were," murmured
Bart.</p>

<p>"I suppose I might worry it out of Wacker,
when he gets his head clear," suggested Green.</p>

<p>"I don't believe he would tell you the truth&mdash;and
he might suspect."</p>

<p>"Suspect what?" demanded Green keenly.</p>

<p>"Never mind, Mr. Green. Can I take a look
into the room where they spent the evening?"</p>

<p>"Certainly&mdash;go right in."</p>

<p>Bart held his breath, nearly suffocated by the
mixed liquor and tobacco taint in the close, disorderly
looking apartment.</p>

<p>His eye passed over the stained table, the
broken glasses and litter of cigar stubs. Then
he came nearer to the table. One corner was
covered with chalk marks.</p>

<p>They apparently represented the score of the
games the trio had played. There were three
columns.</p>

<p>At the head of one was scrawled the name
"Wacker," at the second "Buck," at the third
"Hank."</p>

<p>Bart wondered if he had better try to interview
Lem Wacker. He decided in the negative.</p>

<p>In the first place, Wacker would not be likely
to talk with him&mdash;if he did, he would be on his
guard and prevaricate; and, lastly, as long as
he was asleep he was out of mischief, and helpless
to interfere with Bart.</p>

<p>The young express agent left the Sharp Corner
without saying anything further to Silas Green.</p>

<p>He had his theory, and his plan. His theory
was that Lem Wacker, with a perfect knowledge
of the express office situation, had "fixed" the
night watchman's lunch, and employed two accomplices
to do the rest of the work.</p>

<p>When Wacker woke up, he would simply
say he had sold his rig to two strangers, and,
so far as the actual burglary was concerned,
would be able to prove a conclusive <i>alibi</i>.</p>

<p>The men who had committed the deed had
driven off with the wagon and trunk, and by this
time were undoubtedly at a safe distance in
hiding.</p>

<p>Bart went home, got his breakfast, told his
mother a trunk had got lost and he might have
to go down the road to look it up, returned to
the express office, found Darry Haven and McCarthy
on duty, gave them some routine directions,
and left the place.</p>

<p>Darry Haven followed him outside with a
rather serious face.</p>

<p>"Bart," he said anxiously, "Mrs. Colonel
Harrington drove down here a few minutes
ago."</p>

<p>"About the trunk, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Yes, and she was wild over it. Said you had
got rid of the trunk to spite her, because she had
had some trouble with your mother."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! Anything else?"</p>

<p>"If the trunk don't show up to-day, she says
she will have you arrested."</p>

<p>Bart shrugged his shoulders, but he was consciously
uneasy.</p>

<p>"What did you tell her, Darry?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"I put on all the official dignity I could assume,
but was very polite all the time, informed her
that mislaid, delayed and irregular express matter
were common occurrences, that the company was
responsible for its contracts, counted you one of its
most reliable agents, and assured her that very
possibly within twenty-four hours she would find
her trunk delivered safe and sound at its destination."</p>

<p>"Good for you!" laughed Bart. "Keep an
eye on things. I'll show up, or wire, by night."</p>

<p>"Any clew, Bart?"</p>

<p>"I think so."</p>

<p>Bart went straight to the home of Professor
Abner Cunningham.</p>

<p>That venerable gentleman&mdash;antiquarian, scientist
and profound scholar&mdash;had a queer little place
at the edge of the town where he raised wonderful
bees, and grew freak squashes inside glass molds
in every grotesque shape imaginable.</p>

<p>He was a friend to all the boys in town, and
Bart joined him without ceremony as he found
him out on the lawn in his skull cap and dressing
gown, studying a hornets' nest with a magnifying
glass.</p>

<p>"Ah, young Bartley&mdash;or Bartholomew, is it?"
smiled the innocent-faced old scientist jovially.
"I have a new volume on nomenclature that gives
quite an interesting chapter on the Bartholomew
subject. It takes you back to the eleventh century,
in France&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Professor, excuse me," interrupted Bart gracefully,
"but something very vital to the twentieth
century is calling for urgent attention, and I
wanted to ask you a question or two."</p>

<p>"Surely. Glad to tell you anything," assured
the professor, happiest always when he was talking,
and willing to talk for hours with anyone
who would listen to him. "Come into the library."</p>

<p>"I really haven't the time, Professor," said
Bart. "Please let me ask if you had charge of
getting up that directory of the county that a city
firm published?"</p>

<p>"Two years ago? yes," nodded the professor
assentingly. "It was quite a pleasant and profitable
task. I believe I saw about every resident in
the county in preparing that directory."</p>

<p>"I am going to ask you a foolish question, perhaps,
Professor," continued Bart, "for an accurate
person like you of course took down only correct
names, and not nicknames. Here is the gist of it,
then. I am looking for two men, and I know
only that they live outside of Pleasantville, and
call themselves Buck and Hank."</p>

<p>"Well! well! well!" muttered Professor Cunningham
in a musing tone. "Hank, proper
name Henry; Buck, proper name Buckingham&mdash;hold
on, I've got it! Come in!" insisted the
professor animatedly. "Oh, you haven't time?
Buckingham? Sure thing! Wait here, just a
minute."</p>

<p>The professor rushed into the house, and
in about two minutes came rushing out again.</p>

<p>He had an open book in his hand, and
stumbled over flower beds and walks recklessly
as he consulted it on the run, spilling out some
loose papers it contained, and leaving a white
trail behind him.</p>

<p>"You see here the value of keeping notes of
everything," he panted, on reaching Bart&mdash;"nothing
is lost in this world, however small. Here
we are: 'County at large.' Now then, in my
private notes: 'Allessandro' uncommon name&mdash;'look
up&mdash;probably Greek.' 'Alaric, Altemus,
Artemas, Benno, Borl, Bud&mdash;derived from Budlongor,
Budmeister&mdash;Buck'&mdash;I've got it: 'Buckingham,
last name Tolliver, residence: Millville,
occupation none.' Hold on. We've got the
clew&mdash;now for the town record."</p>

<p>The Professor again flitted away to the house,
and darted back again with a new volume in his
hand.</p>

<p>"Here you are!" he cried, selecting a printed
page. "'Millville, population two hundred and
sixty, not on railroad. R.S.T. Tappan, Tevens,
Tolliver'&mdash;Ah, 'Buckingham Tolliver, Henry
Tolliver,' must be brothers, I fancy. That's all
I've got on record. Information any use to
you?"</p>

<p>"Is it?" cried Bart, in profound admiration
of the old bookworm's system. "Professor,
you are the wisest man and one of the best men
I ever met!"</p>

<h3>A DUMB FRIEND</h3>


<p>At three o'clock that afternoon Bart Stirling
sat down to rest at the side of a dusty country
road, pretty well tired out, and about ready to
return to Pleasantville.</p>

<p>When old Professor Cunningham gave him
the names Buck and Hank Tolliver, Bart was
positive that the same covered the identity of the
two men who had been at the Sharp Corner with
Lem Wacker.</p>

<p>Bart had started at once for Millville. His
first intention was to get a conveyance at the
livery stable, his first impulse to solicit the co-operation
of the town police.</p>

<p>While discussing these points mentally, however,
a farmer driving west came down the road.
He had a good team, said he was passing through
Millville, seemed glad to give Bart a lift, and so
it was that the young express agent found himself
on the solitary lookout there, two hours before
noon.</p>

<p>He experienced no difficulty whatever in finding
out all about the Tollivers inside of twenty
minutes after his arrival.</p>

<p>They were the last members of a shiftless,
indolent family who had lived on the edge of
Millville for twenty years.</p>

<p>When the father and mother died the family
broke up. The two boys, Buck and Hank, kept
bachelor's hall at the ricketty old ruin of a house
on the river until ejected by its owner for non-payment
of rent, and then went to the bad generally.</p>

<p>They patched up an abandoned shack over on
the bottoms, the postmaster at Millville told
Bart, and lived by fishing, hunting and their depredations
on orchards and chicken coops.</p>

<p>In one of their nightly forays about a year previous
they were captured and fined heavily.
They could not pay the fine and were sent to
jail for six months.</p>

<p>About the first of June they were released, came
back to Millville, found their old shack burned
down, and since then, the postmaster understood,
had camped out in the woods, giving the town a
wide berth&mdash;in fact, only occasionally appearing, to
buy a little flour, sugar or coffee, or, mostly,
tobacco.</p>

<p>Nobody had seen them for over a week&mdash;nobody
knew anything of a newly-painted red
wagon.</p>

<p>It seemed probable, Bart theorized, that if they
had made for hiding in any of their familiar woodland
haunts, they had reached the same by driving
through Millville before daylight, and when nobody
was astir.</p>

<p>Bart finally found a woodcutter who knew where
the Tollivers had had their camping place the
week previous. He described the spot and Bart
was soon there&mdash;a secluded gully about two miles
from town.</p>

<p>The place showed evidences of having been
used as a camp, but not recently, and Bart went
on a general blind hunt.</p>

<p>He traversed the woods for miles, both sides of
a dried up rivercourse, and inquired at farmhouses
and of occasional pedestrians he met.</p>

<p>It was all of no avail. At three o'clock in the
afternoon, tired, bramble-torn and a little discouraged,
he sat down by the roadside to rest and
think. He began to censure himself for taking
the independent course he had pursued.</p>

<p>"I should have telegraphed the company the
circumstances of the burglary, and put the matter
in the hands of the Pleasantville police," he reflected.
"If the trunk had belonged to anybody
except Mrs. Colonel Harrington, I would have
done so at once. Somebody coming!" he interrupted
his soliloquy, as he caught a vague movement
through the shrubbery where the road
curved.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;it's only a dog."</p>

<p>The animal came into view going a straight, fast
course, its head drooping, a broken rope trailing
from its neck.</p>

<p>Bart suddenly sprang to his feet, for, studying
the animal more closely, something familiar presented
itself and he ran out into the middle of the
road.</p>

<p>"Come here&mdash;good fellow!" he hailed coaxingly,
as the animal approached.</p>

<p>But with a slight growl, and eyeing him suspiciously,
it made a detour in the road, passing him.</p>

<p>"Lem Wacker's dog&mdash;I am sure of that!" explained
Bart, naturally excited. "Come, old fellow&mdash;here!
here! what is his name? I've got it&mdash;Christmas.
Come here, Christmas!"</p>

<p>The dog halted suddenly, faced about, and
stared at Bart.</p>

<p>Then, when he repeated the name, it sank to
its haunches panting, and, head on one side, regarded
him inquiringly.</p>

<p>The animal was a big half-breed mastiff and
shepherd dog that Lem Wacker had introduced
to his railroad friends with great unction, one
Christmas day.</p>

<p>He had claimed it to be a gift from a friend
just returned from Europe, who had brought over
the famous litter of pups of which it was one.</p>

<p>Wacker had estimated its value at five hundred
dollars. Next day he cut the price in half. New
Year's day, being hard up, he confidentially offered
to sell it for five dollars.</p>

<p>After that it went begging for fifty cents and
trade, and no takers. Lem kicked the poor animal
around as "an ornery, no-good brute," and
had to keep it tied up on his own premises all of
the time to evade paying for a license tag.</p>

<p>Meeting the dog now, gave a new animation
to Bart's thoughts.</p>

<p>The sequence of its appearance, here, ten miles
away from home, was easy to pursue. It had
broken away from its new owners&mdash;Buck and
Hank Tolliver&mdash;and they were somewhere further
up the road.</p>

<p>Christmas was making for home. It was hardly
possible that the animal knew Bart, for, although
he had seen it several times, he had never spoken
to it before. The call of its name, however, had
checked the animal, and now as Bart drew a
cracker from his pocket and extended it, the
dog began to advance slowly and cautiously towards
him.</p>

<p>Bart saw the importance of making a friend of
the animal. He stood perfectly still, talking in
a gentle, persuasive tone.</p>

<p>Christmas came up to him timorously, sniffed
all about his feet, and suddenly wagged its tail
and put its feet up on him in a friendly manifestation
of delight.</p>

<p>Its keen sense of scent had apparently recognized
that Bart had been a visitor to the Wacker
home that day. It now took the cracker from
Bart's hand, then another, and as Bart sat down
again stretched itself placidly and contentedly at
his side.</p>

<p>"This looks all right," ruminated Bart speculatively.
"If I can only get Christmas to go
back the way he came, I feel I have found the
right trail."</p>

<p>Bart finally arose, and the dog, too. The animal
turned its face east, wagged its tail expectantly,
and eagerly studied Bart's face and movements.</p>

<p>As he took a step up the road the animal's
tail went down, nerveless, and its eyes regarded
him beseechingly.</p>

<p>"Come on, old fellow!" hailed Bart encouragingly,
patting the dog. It followed him reluctantly.
Then he made a rollic of it, jumping
the ditch, racing the animal, stopping abruptly,
leaping over it, apparently making Christmas forget
everything except that it had a friendly companion.</p>

<p>At length Bart induced the dog to go ahead.
It led the way with evident reluctance. It would
stop and eye Bart with a decidedly serious eye.
He urged it forward, and finally it got down to a
slow trot, sniffing the road and looking altogether
out of harmony with its forced course.</p>

<p>Christmas was about twenty yards ahead of
Bart at the end of a two miles' jaunt, when he
shied to the extreme edge of the road and drew
to his haunches.</p>

<p>Here wagon tracks led into the timber. The
road had been used lately, Bart soon discerned.</p>

<p>"Come on, Christmas!" he hailed, branching
off into the new obscure roadway.</p>

<p>The dog circled him, but could not be induced
to leave the main road. Bart made a grab for
the trailing rope. The animal eluded him, gave
him one reproachful look, turned its nose east,
and shot off, headed for home like an arrow.</p>

<p>"I've lost my ally," murmured Bart, "but I
think I have got my clew. Christmas does not
like this road, which looks as if he left his captors
somewhere down its length. I'll try to locate
them."</p>

<p>Bart followed the tortuous windings of the
narrow road, through brush, over hillocks, down
into depressions, and finally into the timber.</p>

<p>He came to a clearing, forcing his way past
a border of prickly bushes, the tops of which
seemed freshly broken, as though a wagon had
recently passed over them.</p>

<p>As he got past them, Bart came to a decisive
halt, and stared hard and with a thrill of satisfaction.</p>

<p>Twenty feet away, under a spreading tree, a
horse was tethered, and right near it was a red
wagon&mdash;holding a trunk.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<h3>FOOLING THE ENEMY</h3>


<p>Our hero's impulse was to at once spring
into the wagon and see if the trunk was still
intact.</p>

<p>A natural cautiousness checked him, however,
and he was glad of it a minute later as he detected
a rustling in the thick undergrowth back of the
tree.</p>

<p>A human figure seemed suddenly to drop to
the ground, and a little distance to the left of it
Bart was sure he saw two sharp human eyes fixed
upon him.</p>

<p>He never let on that he suspected for a moment
that he was not entirely alone, but, walking over to
a tree stump, where, spread out on a newspaper,
was the remains of a lunch, he acted delighted at
the discovery, picked up a hunk of bread in one
hand, a piece of cheese in the other, and, throwing
himself on the green sward at full length, proceeded
to munch the eatables, with every semblance
of satisfaction.</p>

<p>Bart's mind worked quickly. He felt that it
was up to him to play a part, and he prepared to
do so.</p>

<p>He was morally certain that two persons in
fancied hiding were watching his every movement,
and they must be Buck and Hank Tolliver.</p>

<p>Bart hoped they had never seen him before; he
felt pretty certain that they did not know him at all.</p>

<p>Bart sprang to his feet. He had thrown his
cap back on his head in a "sporty," off-handish
way, and he tried hard to impersonate a reckless
young adventurer taking things as they came, and
audacious enough to pick up a handy meal anyhow
or anywhere. He paid not the least apparent
attention to the wagon or the trunk, although
he cast more than one sidelong glance in that direction.</p>

<p>He walked up to the horse, stroked its nose,
and said boisterously:</p>

<p>"Wish I had this layout&mdash;wouldn't I reach
California like a nabob, though!"</p>

<p>Then Bart went back to the stump. He purposely
faced the patch of brush where he knew
his watchers were lurking.</p>

<p>Ransacking his pockets, with a comical, quizzical
grin on his face, he produced a solitary
nickel, placed it ostentatiously on the tree stump
and remarked:</p>

<p>"Honesty is the best policy&mdash;there you are,
landlord! and much obliged for the handout."</p>

<p>Then, striking a jaunty dancing step, he started
to cross the clearing, whistling a jolly tune.</p>

<p>"Hey!"</p>

<p>Bart half expected the summons. He halted
in professed wonderment, looked up, to the right,
to the left, in every direction except that from
which he was well aware the hail had come.</p>

<p>"Look here, you!"</p>

<p>Bart now turned in the right direction. A man
of about thirty had revealed himself from the
brush.</p>

<p>He had small, bright eyes, a shrewd, narrow
face, and Bart knew from discription who he was&mdash;Buck
Tolliver.</p>

<p>"Why, hello! somebody here?" exclaimed
Bart, feigning surprise and then fright, and he
made a movement as if to run for it.</p>

<p>"Don't you bolt," ordered Buck Tolliver, advancing&mdash;"come
back here, kid."</p>

<p>Bart slowly retraced his steps. Then he manifested
new alarm as a second figure stepped out
from the brush.</p>

<p>Recalling what the Millville postmaster had
told him, the young express agent was quickly
aware that this second individual was Buck's
brother, Hank.</p>

<p>Buck was the spokesman and leader. He
came up near to Bart and looked him over critically.</p>

<p>"What you doing here?" he demanded, with
a suspicious frown.</p>

<p>"Nothing," said Bart, with a grin.</p>

<p>"Where do you come from?"</p>

<p>"Me&mdash;nowhere!" chuckled Bart, winking deliberately
and then, walking over to the horse, he
fondled his long ears, with the remark: "If I
had a dandy rig like you've got here, I bet I'd
go somewheres, though!"</p>

<p>"Where would you go?" inquired Buck Tolliver
curiously.</p>

<p>"I'd go to California&mdash;that's the place to
do something, and make a name, and amount to
something."</p>

<p>Bart's off-handed ingenuousness had completely
disarmed the men. He pretended to be busy
petting the horse, but saw Buck Tolliver slip
back to his brother, and a few quick questions
and answers passed between them. Then Buck
came up to him again.</p>

<p>"See here, kid, are you acquainted around
here at all?"</p>

<p>"Did you ever see me around here before?"
chaffed Bart audaciously.</p>

<p>"Don't get fresh! This is business."</p>

<p>"Why, yes&mdash;I reckon I could find my way
from Springfield to Bascober."</p>

<p>Bart had mentioned two points miles remote
from the Millville district.</p>

<p>"He'll do," spoke Hank Tolliver for the first
time. "Ask him, Buck."</p>

<p>"Do you want to drive that rig a few miles for
us for a dollar?" asked Buck Tolliver.</p>

<p>"Me?" cried Bart. "I guess so!"</p>

<p>"Can you obey orders?"</p>

<p>"Try me, boss."</p>

<p>"He'll do, I tell you. What do you want to
waste time this way for!" snapped Hank Tolliver
irritably.</p>

<p>"Hitch him up," ordered Buck to Bart.
"Come on, Hank."</p>

<p>Bart chuckled to himself. He did not know
what all this might lead to, but it was a famous
start.</p>

<p>While he was putting on the horse's harness
and hitching him up, the brothers spread a
piece of canvas over the wagon box. This
they tucked in, and completely covered trunk
and canvas with long grass pulled from the edge
of a water pit near by.</p>

<p>Bart had the rig in full starting shape by the
time they had concluded their labors.</p>

<p>"What's the ticket, Captain?" he inquired of
Buck, looking him squarely in the face.</p>

<p>"You seem to know enough not to answer
questions about yourself," observed Buck&mdash;"try
and be as clever if anybody quizzes you about this
wagon."</p>

<p>"Why should they?"</p>

<p>"Oh, they may. If they do, you're from&mdash;let
me see&mdash;Blackberry Hill, remember?"</p>

<p>"All right&mdash;with a load of garden truck, eh?"
propounded Bart ingeniously.</p>

<p>"You hit it correct. What we want you to do
is this: Drive down to the main road, and turn
west. Keep on straight ahead, and don't turn
anywhere. About nine miles west you'll hit
Hamilton. Drive right through the town, but
as soon as you get out of it take the first branch
south from the turnpike, and keep on till you
reach an old mill on the river. Wait for us
there."</p>

<p>"Why," said Bart, "aren't you going with
me?"</p>

<p>"No," answered Buck Tolliver definitely.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"None of your business," snapped out Hank.</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>"You mind yours, strictly, or there will be
trouble," warned Buck, and Bart saw from the
look in his hard face that he was a dangerous
man, once aroused. "You do this job with neatness
and dispatch, and it will mean a good deal
more than a dollar."</p>

<p>"Crackey!" cried Bart, snapping the whip hilariously&mdash;"maybe
this is one of those story-book
happenings where a fellow strikes fame and fortune!"</p>

<p>"Maybe it is," assented Buck drily.</p>

<p>Bart climbed up to the seat. He started up
the horse, the Tollivers following after the wagon
till they reached the main road.</p>

<p>"When I get to the mill&mdash;" began Bart.</p>

<p>"We'll be there to meet you," announced Buck
Tolliver.</p>

<p>"I don't see," growled Hank in an undertone
to his brother, "why we would take any risk riding
under that grass."</p>

<p>"You leave this affair to me," retorted Buck.
"If the kid gets through all right, then we're all
right, aren't we?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so."</p>

<p>"And we've got to wait as we agreed&mdash;for
Wacker."</p>

<p>Bart had just turned into the main road. At
the mention of that ominous name, the young express
agent brought the whip down upon the
horse's flanks with a sharp snap.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<h3>BART ON THE ROAD</h3>


<p>"Get up!"</p>

<p>The rig that Bart was driving sped along the
dusty country road at a good sharp pace.</p>

<p>The young express agent was undergoing the
most vivid mental perturbation of his career.</p>

<p>He kept whistling a jolly air, with a sidelong
glance observed that his recent companions had
turned back towards their camp in the clearing,
and then, dropping his assumption of the reckless
young adventurer, stared seriously ahead and began
to figure out the situation in all its details.</p>

<p>What had come about was quite natural and
ordinary: the Tollivers were anxious to get further
away from the scene of their recent crime, to
a safer and more obscure haunt than the open
camp in the woods.</p>

<p>They dared not take the journey in the day
time, as they did not wish to be seen by anyone
and Bart coming along, they had caught at the
idea of sending him on with the wagon and its
load.</p>

<p>If Bart got through in safety, they could assume
that the hunt for the missing trunk was not very
active, or had been started in some other direction.</p>

<p>Bart had comprehended that they could take a
short cut to the old mill. He had actually
laughed to himself at the ease with which he had
obtained possession of the trunk, until they had
mentioned that ominous name: Lem Wacker.</p>

<p>"They are going to wait for Wacker!" murmured
Bart, as he urged on the horse. "That
means that they expect him soon, for they calculate
on being at the old mill as soon as I can
make it by road. When he does come, and they
tell him about me, he's sure to guess the truth.
Then it's three to one&mdash;get up!"</p>

<p>Bart did not allow the horse to lag, but his best
pace was a poor shambling trot. All the time
Bart thought deeply and practically.</p>

<p>"I have decided," he spoke definitely after a
quarter of an hour. "I shall turn to my left the
first road I come to. The B. &amp; M. does not
touch short of eight miles from here, but somewhere
to the southeast is Clyde Station. Once
there, I'll risk the rest."</p>

<p>The road was not an easy one. It was not
very smooth, and grew more stony and rutty as
he proceeded, and there was a sharp climb for the
horse as they reached a hilly landscape.</p>

<p>Bart halted finally. A road branched to the
left. It did not look very inviting, nor did it seem
to be much in use, but as it led away from
the main highway, it broke the trail, and without
hesitation he turned the horse's head in the direction
of Clyde Station.</p>

<p>The country was open here, all rocks, gullies
and pits. He was surprised to observe how little
distance he had really put between himself and
the Tolliver camp as the road wound out along
the crest of a hill.</p>

<p>He jumped out to lighten the load and coax
up the horse. Then he stood stock-still, straining
his eyes across the valley.</p>

<p>"I declare!" said Bart in a tone of profound
concern, "I got away just in time, but if that is
Lem Wacker, he has appeared on the scene just
ten minutes too soon to suit me."</p>

<p>Over at the break in the woods a man had
appeared from the direction of Millville. He was
waving a hand, and then placing it to his mouth
as though hailing someone, probably the Tollivers
at the camp.</p>

<p>Then he turned straight around. If Bart could
read anything at that distance, he could certainly
trace that the man was looking fixedly at the red
wagon, and the white horse, and himself.</p>

<p>If it was Lem Wacker&mdash;and Bart believed that
it was&mdash;just one thing was in order: to get that
trunk to some town, to some station, to some
friendly farmhouse, in hiding anywhere, before
the pursuit, sure to follow, was started.</p>

<p>Bart ran on, with a last glance at the lone distant
figure. He could not afford to wait to see
if the Tollivers joined it. Every minute was
precious.</p>

<p>"Where is the horse?" exclaimed Bart.</p>

<p>Dobbin had "got up." While Bart was surveying
the landscape, the old animal had plodded
on, and was now out of sight.</p>

<p>Bart ran along the road. It turned between
two walls of slate. Then came the open again.
Here the road descended somewhat. The horse
stood at a halt. He had run easily a few rods, one
wheel had struck a deep rut, and the wagon had
broken down. It lay tilted over on one side,
one wheel completely caved in.</p>

<p>Bart was dismayed. He reflected for a moment,
and then followed the road ahead for about
a hundred feet.</p>

<p>It turned through some slate heaps, lined the
side of a deep excavation, and came to an abrupt
end where some boards, placed crosswise, barred
the sheer descent.</p>

<p>Just such a valley spread out beyond the barrier
as on the other edge of the hill whence Bart
had seen the man he believed to be Lem Wacker.</p>

<p>Here, however, the landscape was barren in
the extreme. There was not a house visible.</p>

<p>Bart was in a dilemma, but he decided how he
would act. He first ran back to the spot whence
he had last viewed the break in the woods.</p>

<p>A glance stirred him up to prompt and decisive
action.</p>

<p>Three men were now in view. They were
running at their top bent of speed up the road he
had taken.</p>

<p>"Lem Wacker and the Tollivers, sure!" murmured
Bart. "They know the wagon is up here
somewhere, and they will be here in less than
half an hour."</p>

<p>Bart's one idea now was to locate some pit or
cranny where he could stow the trunk where it
could not be readily found.</p>

<p>This done, he would start on foot in the direction
of Clyde Station to get assistance and return
before his enemies discovered it.</p>

<p>There were all kinds of holes and heaps around
him, but too open and public to his way of thinking.
Exploring, he came to the board barrier
again, climbed over it, and more critically than before
scanned the fifty-foot descent, and what lay
at the bottom.</p>

<p>"Why!" said Bart, in some astonishment,
"there's a railroad track&mdash;"</p>

<p>He leaned over, and scrutinizingly ran his eye
along the dull brown stretch of raised rails.</p>

<p>"And a hand car!" shouted the young express
agent joyfully.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<h3>A LIMB OF THE LAW</h3>


<p>The single track which Bart had discovered
lined the bottom of the hill, followed it for a
distance, and then running across the valley
disappeared in among other hills and the timber.</p>

<p>It was a rickety concern, was unballasted, and
looked as if, loosely thrown together, it had never
filled its original mission and had been practically
abandoned.</p>

<p>"I don't know of any branch of the B. &amp; M.
hereabouts," ruminated the young express agent&mdash;"certainly
none corresponding to this is on the
map. It is not in regular use, but that hand car
looks as if it was doing service right along."</p>

<p>No one was in sight about the place, yet lying
in plain view on the hand car were three or four
coats and jumpers and as many dinner pails.</p>

<p>"I have no time to figure it out," breathed
Bart quickly. "The first thing to do is to get
the trunk down there."</p>

<p>Bart ran back to the wagon. He hurriedly
pulled away the grass covering and then the canvas.</p>

<p>The trunk was revealed. He had his first full
glance at it since it had been delivered to him at
the express office at Pleasantville, the afternoon
previous.</p>

<p>"It's all right," he said with satisfaction, after
a critical inspection. "There is the paster I
slapped over the front. The trunk could not
have been opened without tearing that."</p>

<p>He got a good purchase on a handle and landed
the trunk in the road. Then he dragged it up to
the barrier, removed a board, and, perspiring and
breathing hard, held it at the sheer edge of the
decline and let it slide.</p>

<p>The hand car was a light-running affair, well-greased,
in pretty good order, and he could
readily observe was in constant use.</p>

<p>Upon it lay the clothing and dinner pails he
had noticed from overhead. They evidently belonged
to workmen&mdash;but where were they?</p>

<p>"I can hardly wait to find out," declared Bart.</p>

<p>He pushed off the clothing and dinner pails
and lifted on the trunk.</p>

<p>Then Bart made a depressing discovery&mdash;the
hind gearing was locked with a chain running
from wheel to wheel.</p>

<p>This was unfortunate. Turning a heap of slate,
he came suddenly and with delight upon an open
tool box.</p>

<p>It was a regular construction case, and full of
shovels, crowbars, pickaxes, sledges and drills.
Bart selected a crowbar and his efforts to twist
and snap the chain resulted in final success. With
a thrill of satisfaction he sprang upon the car.
The handles moved easily and responsively to the
touch.</p>

<p>A grumbling roar caused him to survey the sky,
which had been dull and lowering since noon.</p>

<p>"Storm coming," he murmured&mdash;"now for action!"</p>

<p>Bart started up the car. It ran as smooth as a
bicycle. He was anxious to get away from the
face of the hill, not knowing how near the enemy
might be.</p>

<p>They were nearer than he fancied, for a sudden
shout rang out, then a chorus of them.</p>

<p>A piece of rock, hurled down from the crest of
the hill, struck his wrist, nearly numbing it.
Glancing up, Bart saw the two Tollivers and Lem
Wacker getting ready to descend.</p>

<p>There was a sharp incline and a short curve
not ten feet ahead. Bart let the hand car drive at
its own impetus.</p>

<p>"Stop!" yelled Buck Tolliver.</p>

<p>He held some object in his hand. Bart
crouched by the side of the pumping standard,
and the hand car spun out on the tracks crossing
the valley, just as the thunder-storm broke forth
in all its fury.</p>

<p>Bart's back was to the wind, and the wind
helped his progress. As the tracks led into the
timber, Bart took a last glance backwards, but rain
and mist shut out all sight of the hill and his
enemies.</p>

<p>He had no idea as to the terminus or connections
of the railroad, but never relaxed his efforts
as long as clear tracks showed beyond.</p>

<p>Bart must have gone six or seven miles, when
he saw ahead some scattered houses, then a church
steeple and a water tower, and he caught the echo
of a locomotive whistle.</p>

<p>"It's the B. &amp; M., and that is Lisle Station!"
he soliloquized with unbounded satisfaction.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later, wringing wet with rain
and perspiration, Bart drove the hand car up to a
bumper just behind a little country depot, and
leaped to the ground.</p>

<p>"Hello!" hailed a man inside, the station
agent, staring hard at him through an open window.</p>

<p>Bart nodded calmly, consulting his watch and
calculating mentally in a rapid way.</p>

<p>"See here," he said briskly, "this is Lisle Station?"</p>

<p>"Sure."</p>

<p>"On the B. &amp; M. Then the afternoon express
is due here from the east in twelve minutes."</p>

<p>"You seem to be well-posted."</p>

<p>"I ought to be," answered Bart&mdash;"I am the
express agent at Pleasantville."</p>

<p>"What!" ejaculated the man incredulously.</p>

<p>"Yes," nodded Bart, smiling. "Won't you
help me get this trunk to the platform?"</p>

<p>The station agent came outside and lent a hand
as suggested, but he remarked:</p>

<p>"The express doesn't stop here."</p>

<p>"Flag it."</p>

<p>"My orders&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Won't interfere, in this case," insisted Bart.
"That trunk has got two thousand dollars worth of
stuff in it, and was stolen. I recovered it, the
thieves are after me, and it has got to go to Cedar
Lake on Number 18."</p>

<p>"Well! well! well!" muttered the station
agent in a daze, but hastening to place the stop
signal.</p>

<p>Bart went inside and unceremoniously approached
the office desk. He wrote on a slip
of paper, placed it in his pocket, shifted the trunk
to the head end of the platform, and stationed
himself beside it.</p>

<p>"Is all that you're telling me true?" propounded
the bewildered station agent, sidling up
to Bart's side.</p>

<p>"Every word of it."</p>

<p>"Where did you get the hand car?"</p>

<p>"I found it. Oh, by the way! I wish you
would explain to me about that railroad; what is
it, what excuse has it got for existing?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that?" said the station agent "It's
the old quarry spur. A company built it five
years ago with grand plans for shipping mottled
tiling slate all over the country. Their
money gave out and the scheme was never put
through."</p>

<p>"And the hand car?"</p>

<p>"There's four men who live here who got the
privilege of digging out slate for a big plumbers'
supply house in the city. They go to the
quarry and back on the hand car daily. Did
they loan it to you?"</p>

<p>"No," said Bart, "I was in a hurry, and had
to borrow it without permission."</p>

<p>"They'll have a fine walk back here in this
storm!"</p>

<p>"I was going to suggest," said Bart, taking
half a dollar from his pocket, "that you might
hire some boy to run the hand car back to
the quarry."</p>

<p>"I can do that," answered the station agent.</p>

<p>Number 18 came sailing down the rails. As
she slowed up, everyone on duty from the fireman
to the brakeman was on the lookout for the
cause of the unusual stop.</p>

<p>The conductor jumped off and ran up to the
station agent, and while the latter was busy explaining
the situation Bart hammered on the
door of the express car.</p>

<p>"Why it's Stirling!" cried old Ben Travers,
the veteran express messenger, sliding back the
door.</p>

<p>"You're right, Mr. Travers," assented Bart.
"Here's a special and urgent. Get it aboard
before the conductor comes up and jumps all
over me for stopping the train."</p>

<p>Travers popped down in a lively fashion.
They hoisted the trunk together and sent it
spinning into the car.</p>

<p>"Cedar Lake, make a sure delivery, Mr. Travers,"
directed Bart. "Here, put your manifesto
on that receipt, will you?" and Bart drew the slip
of paper he had written on in the depot from his
pocket.</p>

<p>The conductor, a pompous, self-contained old
fellow, started towards Bart to haul him over the
coals, but Bart wisely walked farther down the
platform, the conductor gave the go-ahead signal
and shook his fist sternly at Bart, while the latter
with a gay, relieved laugh waved him back a
cheery, courteous good-by.</p>

<p>Bart told the station agent a very little about
the history of the trunk. He left a dollar to pay
for the broken hand car lock. He was in high
spirits as he caught the east bound train. The
whistles were blowing for a quarter of six as he
reached Pleasantville and leaped from the engine,
where a friendly engineer had given him a free ride,
and in three minutes was at the door of the little express
office.</p>

<p>Animated voices reached him from the inside.
Bart peered beyond the threshold.</p>

<p>McCarthy, the night watchman, sat asleep in
a chair in a corner. Darry Haven was at the desk,
a spruce, solemn-faced young man beside him.</p>

<p>"I'm here, Darry," announced Bart.</p>

<p>Darry turned with a joyful face. It fell as he
glanced beyond his young employer to the empty
platform.</p>

<p>"No trunk!" he murmured in a low, disappointed
tone.</p>

<p>"Too heavy to carry around, you see!" smiled
Bart lightly. "Who is this gentleman? Oh, I
see&mdash;good afternoon, Mr. Stuart."</p>

<p>"Afternoon," crisply answered the stranger.</p>

<p>He was a young limb of the law, employed
since the previous year in the office of Judge
Monroe, the principal attorney of Pleasantville.</p>

<p>Stuart was a butt for even the well-meaning
boys of the town. He was only nineteen, but he
affected the dignity of a sage of sixty, seeming to
have the idea that nothing but a severe and forbidding
manner could represent the high and lofty
calling he had condescended to follow.</p>

<p>"Ah," he observed, turning upon Bart and
critically adjusting a single eyeglass, "is this the
express agent?"</p>

<p>"That's me," assented Bart bluntly.</p>

<p>"I represent Monroe, Purcell &amp; Abernethy,
Attorneys," grandly announced Stuart. "We are
employed by Mrs. Harrington to prosecute an inquiry
as to a missing trunk."</p>

<p>Darry looked very serious, Bart smiled serenely
in the face of his imperturbable visitor.</p>

<p>"What is there to prosecute, Mr. Stuart?" he
inquired.</p>

<p>"We have come to demand certified copies of
all entries and receipts of this office covering the
trunk in question," announced the young sprig of
the law.</p>

<p>"Well?" interrogated Bart.</p>

<p>"Your employee&mdash;assistant? here, declined to
act without your authority."</p>

<p>"Quite right. I give it, though. Darry, make
out transcripts of the records. That is all clear
and regular."</p>

<p>Bart turned on his heel, ran his eye over the
office books, and bored young Mr. Stuart terribly
by paying no further attention to him.</p>

<p>The latter stood watching the industrious Darry
with owl-like solemnity. Finally the latter handed
a duplicate receipt and a copy of the entry to Stuart.</p>

<p>"Will you officially attest to the correctness
of these, Mr.&mdash;Ah, Mr. Agent?" propounded
Stuart.</p>

<p>"Sure," answered Bart with an off-handed
alacrity that was distressing to the responsibility
burdened personality of the accredited
representative of Monroe, Purcell &amp; Abernethy.</p>

<p>He dashed off an O.K. on the two documents,
tendered them with exaggerated courtesy
to his visitor, who he was well aware knew his name
perfectly, and said, with the faintest suggestion of
mimicry:</p>

<p>"Ah, Mr.&mdash;Representative, would you kindly
inform me for what purpose you want these transcripts?"</p>

<p>"They form the basis of a criminal prosecution,"
announced young Stuart in a tone positively
sepulchral.</p>

<p>"So?" murmured the young express agent
smoothly. "In that case, let me suggest that
you also take a copy of this document to submit
to your&mdash;superiors."</p>

<p>Bart Stirling drew from his pocket the receipt
signed by old Ben Travers on the afternoon express
less than two hours previous.</p>

<p>Stuart adjusted his eyeglass and superciliously
regarded the document. Then he turned and
gasped:</p>

<p>"What&mdash;what is this?" he spluttered.</p>

<p>"A receipt for the delivery of the basis of your
criminal prosecution," said Bart simply. "Mrs.
Colonel Harrington's trunk is safe and sound on
its way to its destination."</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" irresistibly shouted Darry Haven.</p>

<h3>BART STIRLING, AUCTIONEER</h3>


<p>It was "busy times" at the little express office
at Pleasantville.</p>

<p>Bart had made home and lunch in half the
noon hour, and entered upon a renewal of his
duties with a brisk hail to his subordinates and
assistants, Darry and Bob Haven.</p>

<p>On that especial day the services of both
had been required. They had arranged to give
their full time, and Bart noted that never were
there more industrious and enthusiastic colleagues.</p>

<p>There was the sound of active hammering
as Bart entered the office, which Darry suspended
long enough to remark:</p>

<p>"How's that for the audience?"</p>

<p>The office space proper containing the desk
and the safe had been railed off, the express stuff
in and out packed conveniently in one corner,
and thus three-quarters of the room was given up
solely to the requirements of the day.</p>

<p>A dozen rough benches filled in half the space.
Its other half, also railed off, held a heap of
packages, bundles, boxes, barrels, a mass of heterogeneous
plunder, packed up neatly, and convenient
for handling.</p>

<p>Beside it was a raised platform, and this in
turn held a rough board table on which lay a
home-made gavel, and beside this was a high
desk holding a blank book and a tin box.</p>

<p>What was "coming off" was the much advertised
unclaimed package sale of the express company.</p>

<p>Bart had followed out the instructions received
from Mr. Leslie, the superintendent, when he
first took charge of the office at Pleasantville,
and the sale and its details had been quite an element
in his life during the past three weeks.</p>

<p>The various small offices in the division had
sent in their uncalled for express matter, and this
was now grouped under the present roof.</p>

<p>Mr. Haven, an ex-editor, had written up a
good "puff" for a local paper, inserted gratis
an exciting comment and anticipation in reference
to the impending sale, and Darry and Bob had
printed fifteen hundred dodgers on their home
press, very neat and presentable in appearance,
and these had been judiciously distributed for miles
around, and posted up in stores and depots.</p>

<p>Bart had heard nothing further from the Harringtons&mdash;not
even the echo of a "thank you"
had reached him. Pleasantville for a day or two
had been full of rumors as to the express robbery,
but Bart decided to say very little about it, and
only his intimate friends knew the actual circumstances.</p>

<p>McCarthy, the night watchman, however, accidentally
spread Bart's fame in the right direction.
He had a cousin working for the express company
in the city to whom he told the story. It
got to the ears of the superintendent of the express
company.</p>

<p>Bart received a letter from Mr. Leslie the next
day, requiring a circumstantial report of the stolen
trunk. He answered this and received a prompt
reply, directing him thereafter to always report
such happenings at once, but his zeal and shrewdness
were heartily commended, and a check for
twenty-five dollars for extra services was inclosed.</p>

<p>The twenty-five dollars Bart received was the
nest egg of a fund being saved up for his father's
benefit.</p>

<p>Mr. Stirling could now distinguish night from
day, and in a few weeks they intended to take
him to an expert oculist in the city for special
treatment.</p>

<p>Amid all this encouragement, Bart's life was
filled with contentment and earnest endeavor,
and he tried to deserve the good fortune that was
his lot, and fulfill every duty thoroughly. About
a week before the present time he had received a
brief letter from his roustabout friend, Baker,
dated from a town about fifty miles away, telling
him that he had been working on a steady job,
but had some business in Pleasantville in a few
days, and asked Bart to write him as to the
whereabouts of Colonel Harrington.</p>

<p>Bart had replied to this letter, wondering what
mystery could possibly connect this homeless
vagabond and the great ruling magnate of Pleasantville.</p>

<p>"Now then, my friends," said Bart briskly, as
he saw to it that everything was in order for the
sale, "the motto for the hour is quick action and
cash on delivery!"</p>

<p>About two o'clock there were several arrivals.
Half an hour later the place was pretty well filled.
There were several village storekeepers, some
traveling men from the hotel, and railroad men
off duty.</p>

<p>Nearly a dozen country rigs drove up to the
platform, and the rural population was well represented.</p>

<p>At three o'clock prompt, as advertised, Bart ascended
the little platform and took up the gavel.</p>

<p>Just then he nodded at a newcomer who entered
the doorway and quietly took a seat. It
was Mr. Baker.</p>

<p>Bart was more pleased than surprised to see him.
He had anticipated his arrival the last two days.</p>

<p>Bart tapped the table to call the crowd to order
and silence.</p>

<p>Then he looked again at the doorway, and this
time with vivid interest.</p>

<p>He saw Lem Wacker shuffle into view, glance
keenly around, fix his eye on Baker, and steal into
the room and sit down directly behind that mysterious
individual.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<h3>"GOING, GOING, GONE!"</h3>


<p>Bart made a first-class auctioneer&mdash;everybody
said so after the sale was over, and the pleased grins
and the good-natured attention of his audience
assured the young novice of this as he concluded
the introductory speech.</p>

<p>He had prepared a simple, witty preface to actual
business, telling many truths of people who had
spent a few cents for what had turned out to be
worth many dollars, and inviting a good many
guesses by hinting what might be in the heap
upon which all eyes were fixed intently.</p>

<p>"Number 1129," said Bart, after taking a brief
breathing spell.</p>

<p>Bob Haven lifted a box about two feet square
to the table.</p>

<p>"Shipped to William Brothers, Ross Junction,"
announced Bart, reading the tag, "not found.
Come, gentlemen! what am I bid for lot 1129?"</p>

<p>"What's in it?" inquired a big farmer sitting
near the front.</p>

<p>"You will have to guess that," answered Bart
pleasantly. "Ah! some kind of liquid, I should
imagine," and he shook the box, its contents echoing
out a mellow, gurgling sound.</p>

<p>"Mebbe it's paint, Samantha?" suggested the
farmer to his wife. "There'd be two gallons of
it&mdash;enough to cover the smokehouse. Ten
cents."</p>

<p>"The charges are eighty-five," explained Bart&mdash;"can't
start it any lower."</p>

<p>A blear-eyed, unsteady individual, whom Bart
recognized as a member of the Sharp Corner contingent,
advanced to the table.</p>

<p>He was thirsty-looking and eager as he poked
at the box and tried to peer into it.</p>

<p>"A demijohn!" he muttered, his mouth watering.
"Two gallons&mdash;probably prime old stuff.
Eighty-five cents."</p>

<p>"Eighty-five&mdash;eighty-five!" repeated Bart.</p>

<p>"Ninety," said the farmer.</p>

<p>"Dollar!" mumbled the thirsty-looking man.</p>

<p>"Do I hear any more?" challenged Bart, gavel
suspended, "once, twice, and sold to&mdash;cash."</p>

<p>The inebriate paid his money, chuckled and
took the box to one side, hugging it like a pet
child, reached over and picked up the hatchet from
inside the railing, and pried open the corner of
the box.</p>

<p>A gleesome roar of merriment interrupted Bart
as he called out the second lot.</p>

<p>The inebriate stood disgustedly looking down
at the label on the demijohn he had brought to
light: "Bubbly Spring Mineral Water."</p>

<p>Lot 943 was a cardboard box. The suggestion
of millinery made the farmer's wife a reckless bidder,
and the lot brought two dollars.</p>

<p>Another roar went up from the crowd as she
eagerly inspected her purchase. It turned out to
be a man's silk hat.</p>

<p>She looked spiteful enough to throw it out of
the window, but her husband, laughing at her,
doffed his worn straw, coolly put on the elaborate
headgear, and became thenceforward a target for
the quips of the merry idlers about the door.</p>

<p>An oblong crate brought four dollars. Bob
Haven got this. He did not inspect his purchase at
once, but with glowing eyes whispered to his
brother as he pushed it to one side that he knew
it was a new bicycle.</p>

<p>Bart hustled the various packages up for sale
and disposition with briskness and dispatch, and
Darry was more than busy keeping tab on his
record book and piling the cash into the tin
box.</p>

<p>One fuming, perspiring man, looking too fat to
ever get cool, found the prize he had drawn was a
moth-eaten fur overcoat.</p>

<p>Peter Grimm, notoriously the stingiest man in
Pleasantville, who raised the sourest apples in the
town and spent most of his time watching the boys
and picking up what fruit rolled outside of the
fence, bided his time with watchful ferret eyes
until a promising-looking package came along.</p>

<p>It was bid up pretty high, and the crowd urged
him to disclose his treasure, but Grimm was not responsive
to any mutual human sentiment and sat
down with the package in his lap.</p>

<p>He began a secret inspection, however, gradually
working off the paper covering at one end,
and with snapping eyes worming his fingers inside
the parcel.</p>

<p>Suddenly a sharp click echoed out, followed by
a frightful yell.</p>

<p>Grimm sprang to his feet, jumping quickly about
and swinging one arm wildly through the air, the
parcel dangling from it like a bulldog hanging on
to a coat tail.</p>

<p>"Murder!" he screamed. "Take it off! take
it off!"</p>

<p>Bart had to step down to the rescue. Peter
Grimm had drawn a patent mink trap, and was
its first victim. He sneaked from the express
office nursing his crushed fingers and kicking his
unlucky purchase out into the road.</p>

<p>The pile of unclaimed stuff diminished rapidly.
The various purchases were productive of all kinds
of fun. Tom Partridge, the colored porter at the
hotel, got a case of face powder, and an exquisite
traveling man for a lace house drew a pair of
rubber boots that would fit a giant.</p>

<p>One man disclosed his purchase to be a setting
of eggs. They were packed in cotton and intact,
though probably a year old.</p>

<p>"Take them out&mdash;take them out," yelled the
crowd.</p>

<p>Somebody dropped a piece of wood in the
box, and there was a pop. The farmer with the
plug hat he-hawed at the top of his voice, the
miserable owner of the eggs got mad at him,
some words ensued, the farmer started after him,
the egg owner ran, once outside fired an egg
which struck the smooth, shiny tile with a splatter,
and the farmer came back into the express
office holding his nose, bareheaded, and looking
for his rejected straw head-covering.</p>

<p>Some, however, were more fortunate. Bart
encouraged and hurried the bidding on a large
crate, the contents of which he easily guessed, as
did also Tim Hager, the crippled son of a poor
widow. Tim got it for two dollars and twenty-five
cents, and it turned out to hold a first-class
sewing machine.</p>

<p>"Your attention for a few moments, gentlemen,"
called out Bart as there was a hustle
on the part of the audience getting together the
mass of stuff they had bought. "All the unclaimed
heavy express matter at Pleasantville was
burned up in the fire of July third, but some
twenty small parcels were in the safe, and those
we will now dispose of."</p>

<p>"Money, jewelry, and such, I suppose?" propounded
Lawyer Stebbings, who loaned money
at a high rate of interest.</p>

<p>"We make no such representations," responded
Bart. "I will say this, that no money
packages are among the lot. There may be
valuable papers, there may be jewelry&mdash;in fact,
some of the parcels have a given value up to
two hundred dollars&mdash;but the express company
guarantees nothing and you bid at your own
risk."</p>

<p>"Good! let's have a sample," demanded Stebbings.
"Can I examine? Ah, thanks."</p>

<p>The crowd passed from hand to hand a small
well-wrapped package.</p>

<p>"Watch!" hoarsely whispered someone.</p>

<p>"Feels like it!" said a second.</p>

<p>Stebbings bid the lot up to four dollars and
got it. There was more fun as he unrolled the
numerous wrappings of the package to disclose a
small metal disc used in a threshing machine.</p>

<p>One purchaser got a gold pen, another a very
pretty stick pin.</p>

<p>Lem Wacker had not engaged in the general
commotion. He had retained his place on a
bench, looking bored, but for some reason sitting
out the session, and Bart wondered why.</p>

<p>Baker took a mild interest in what was going
on, smiling appreciatively once in a while when
Bart made a witty hit or an unusually good
sale.</p>

<p>Finally, however, Wacker put up his forefinger
as Bart was bidding off a thin wooden box
about four inches square.</p>

<p>"Sender: Novelty Jewelry Company, no address,"
read Bart, "shipped to James Barclay,
Millville&mdash;not found. This is a promising-looking
package. Gentlemen, what am I bid?"</p>

<p>Lem Wacker seemed to have some spare cash,
for he paid two dollars for the box, swaggered off
with it, and opening it disclosed a very small
and neat pocket alarm clock.</p>

<p>He wound it up, sent out its silvery call once
or twice for the edification of the crowd about him,
hoping to sell it off to someone, and then, there
being no purchaser, with a disappointed grunt
slipped it into his pocket.</p>

<p>"Number 529," announced Bart a few minutes
later&mdash;"the last package, gentlemen!"</p>

<p>The crowd was dispersing, Darry was counting
up the heap of bank notes and coin in the cash
box, Bob was gloating and wild with delight as
uncovering his purchase he brought to light a new
bicycle.</p>

<p>The package Bart tendered was thin and flat.
Two tough pieces of cardboard held it stiff and
straight. It seemed to contain papers of some
kind, and so many bidders had bought old deeds,
contracts, plans, manuscripts and the like, utterly
valueless to them, that the lot hung at twenty-five
cents for several minutes.</p>

<p>"Come, come, gentlemen!" urged Bart&mdash;"the
last may be the best. The charges are sixty-five
cents. Sender's name not given. Directed to
'A.A. Adams, Pleasantville'&mdash;not found."</p>

<p>"Hoo! S&mdash;s&mdash;say!"</p>

<p>Bart experienced something of a shock.</p>

<p>The familiar cry of the ex-roustabout, Mr.
Baker, rang out sharp and sudden.</p>

<p>Glancing at him, Bart saw that he had arisen to
his feet.</p>

<p>His face was bloodless and twitching, his whole
frame a-quake. His eyes were snapping wildly.
He was like a man who could hardly speak or
stand, and fairly on the verge of a fit.</p>

<p>A wavering finger he pointed at the young
auctioneer, and gasped out.</p>

<p>"One dollar&mdash;two&mdash;three!"</p>

<h3>MR. BAKER'S BID</h3>


<p>The attitude, actions and announcement of the
mysterious Mr. Baker filled Bart Stirling with
profound surprise and wonderment.</p>

<p>The young express agent well knew the erratic
temperment of his singular friend, but Baker had
been so placid and natural up to the present moment,
and this excitable outburst was so vivid and
unaccountable, that Bart felt sure that there was
some important reason for the same.</p>

<p>All eyes were now fixed on Baker. He seemed
to put a dramatic climax to a varied entertainment,
and appeared unconscious of everything except the
package Bart held in his hand. His eyes were
fixed upon this steadfastly&mdash;they seemed to burn
right into it.</p>

<p>Lem Wacker had also arisen to his feet. Bart
noticed him intently studying Baker, sidling up to
him and sinking to the bench directly next to him.</p>

<p>There was a suspiciousness in the action that
enhanced Bart's interest and curiosity, but he preserved
his composure.</p>

<p>"Three dollars, did you say?" he inquired, in
an insinuating and soothing, but strictly business
tone.</p>

<p>"Yes!" gasped out Baker.</p>

<p>"I am bid&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Four."</p>

<p>Bart looked fixedly at Lem Wacker, for it was
he who had spoken. Darry Haven dropped the
cover of the cash box, and also stared at Wacker.
There was something suggestive in the sensation
of the moment.</p>

<p>Lem Wacker's face was as bold as brass. He
was dressed pretty well and looked prosperous,
and there was a mean sneer on his lips as he
shamelessly returned the glance of the boy he
had wronged, defiantly relying, apparently, on
some reserved power he fancied he possessed.</p>

<p>Baker did not even look at the rival bidder.
His very soul seemed centered on the package in
Bart's hand.</p>

<p>"Five," he uttered with an effort&mdash;"six, seven!"</p>

<p>"Eight," said Wacker calmly, striking a cigarette
between his lips.</p>

<p>"Ten."</p>

<p>"Twelve."</p>

<p>Baker was silent. A frightful spasm crossed
his face. He swayed from side to side. Then,
grasping at the bench rails to steady himself, he
came up to the platform.</p>

<p>"Stirling!" he panted hoarsely, "I have no
more money, but I must&mdash;must have that package!
Lend me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Whatever you wish," answered Bart promptly.</p>

<p>"Fifteen dollars!" said Baker.</p>

<p>Lem Wacker jumped to his feet, excited. He
shot a hand into a pocket, drew it out again holding
a pocketbook, ran over its contents, and
shouted!</p>

<p>"Sixteen dollars!"</p>

<p>"Twenty!" cried Baker.</p>

<p>"I am offered twenty dollars," said Bart, outwardly
cool as a cucumber, inwardly greatly perturbed
over the incident in hand, and hastening to
close it in favor of a friend. "Twenty dollars
once, twenty dollars twice&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop!" yelled Lem Wacker.</p>

<p>"Do you bid more?" asked Bart.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I do!"</p>

<p>"How much?"</p>

<p>"Double&mdash;treble&mdash;if I have to!" retorted
Wacker. "Only I want you to wait until I can
get the cash. I have only sixteen dollars with
me&mdash;I can get a hundred and sixty in two minutes,
I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Terms strictly cash," said Bart simply. "Going,
going, at twenty dollars&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hold on! Don't you dare!" raved Wacker,
swinging his arms about like a windmill. "I
demand that this sale be suspended until I can
get further funds."</p>

<p>"Twenty dollars&mdash;gone!" sung out Bart in
the same business tone, "and sold to&mdash;cash."</p>

<p>With a sigh of relief and weakness Baker swayed
sideways to a bench, first extending to Darry
Haven with a shaking hand a little roll of bills.</p>

<p>"Charge me with the balance," said Bart
quickly to his assistant, in a low tone.</p>

<p>"You've no right!" raved Lem Wacker loudly,
shaking his fist at Bart, and in a passion of uncontrollable
rage. "You'll suffer for this! I
protest against this sale&mdash;I demand that you do
not deliver that package, you young snob! you&mdash;"</p>

<p>Lem Wacker was getting abusive. He pranced
about like a mad bull.</p>

<p>A heavy hand dropped suddenly on his collar,
McCarthy, the watchman, gave him a shove towards
the door.</p>

<p>"No talk of that kind allowed here," he remarked
grimly. "Get out, or I'll fire you
out!"</p>

<p>As Wacker disappeared through the doorway,
Bart leaned from the platform.</p>

<p>"Here is your package, Mr. Baker," he said.
"What is the trouble&mdash;are you ill?"</p>

<p>Baker struggled to his feet. He was in a pitiable
state of agitation and nervousness.</p>

<p>"No! no!" he panted, "you keep the package&mdash;for
a time. Till&mdash;till I explain. I've got it!
I've got it at last!" he quavered in an exultant
tone. "Air&mdash;I'm choking! I&mdash;I'll be back
soon&mdash;"</p>

<p>He rushed to the door overcome, like a man on
the verge of a fit.</p>

<p>Bart started to follow him. Just then, however,
one of the recent bidders came up to ask some
question about a purchase which required that
Bart consult the record book.</p>

<p>When he had disposed of the matter, Bart
hurried to the outside. Baker was nowhere in
sight.</p>

<h3>A NIGHT MESSAGE</h3>


<p>The crowd had melted away, Bob Haven was
totally engrossed with the magnificent prize he
had drawn, and Darry was busily engaged in
closing up the records of the sale.</p>

<p>Bart was thoroughly mystified at the strange
conduct of Baker, and very much disappointed at
not finding him, now that he sought the mysterious
man.</p>

<p>McCarthy had gone home, and Lem Wacker
was not in evidence. Some boys were guarding
a pile of stuff that had been purchased and
thrown aside. Bart set at work cleaning up the
package coverings that littered the place inside
and outside.</p>

<p>Things were back to normal when the afternoon
express came in. It was nearly two hours
late, and closing time.</p>

<p>There was the usual grist of store packages,
which Darry attended to, and several special envelopes.
These Bart placed in the safe along
with the proceeds of the day derived from the
sale, barely glancing over the duplicate receipt he
had signed for the messenger.</p>

<p>He noticed that two of the specials were for
the local bank, and the third for the big pickle
factory of Martin &amp; Company, at the edge of the
town.</p>

<p>"Both closed up by this time," ruminated
Bart. "We can't deliver to-night. Anything
very urgent among that stuff, Darry?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," replied his young assistant.</p>

<p>"You can go home, then," directed Bart.
"Pretty tired, eh? A big day's work, this."</p>

<p>"Say, Bart," spoke up Darry, as he dallied at
the door, "who was the fellow that bought that
last package?"</p>

<p>"A friend of mine, Darry," answered Bart
seriously. "And I am worried about him. He
is the man I told you about who helped me save
my father the night of the fire."</p>

<p>"He acted very queerly. And Lem Wacker,
too," added Darry thoughtfully. "Is something
new up, Bart? The way Wacker carried on, he
seemed to have some idea in his head."</p>

<p>"He had the idea he could bulldoze me," said
Bart bluntly, "and found he couldn't. What
bothers me is, why were both of them so anxious
to get this package?"</p>

<p>Bart took it out of his pocket as he spoke,
nodded good night to Darry, and sat down on
a bench, turning the parcel over and over in his
hand.</p>

<p>"A.A. Adams," he read from the tag, "a
queer name, and no one answering to it here in
Pleasantville. I wonder why Baker was so excited
when he heard that name? I wonder why
Lem Wacker bid it up? Is he aware of the
mystery surrounding Baker? Has this package
got something to do with it? Wacker looked as
though he had struck a prosperous streak, and
bragged recklessly about the lot of money he
could get. I must find Baker. He was in no
condition, mentally or physically, to wander about
at random."</p>

<p>The package in question, Bart decided, held
papers. It had been given him in trust, and he
could not open it without Baker's permission.
He replaced it in his pocket and went
forth.</p>

<p>Bart visited all of Baker's old familiar haunts
in the freight yards, but found no trace of him.
Then he called at the Sharp Corner. Its proprietor
claimed that Lem Wacker had not been
there since noon.</p>

<p>Bart spoke to two of the yards night watchmen.
He described Baker, and requested them
to speak to him if they ran across him, and to
tell him that Bart Stirling was very anxious
to see him up at his house.</p>

<p>Affairs at the little express office had settled
down to routine when, one morning, Darry Haven
dropped into the place.</p>

<p>He found Bart engrossed in reading a letter
very carefully. Its envelope lay on the desk.
Glancing at it casually, Darry saw that it was from
express headquarters.</p>

<p>"Anything wrong?" he inquired, as Bart
folded up the letter and placed it in his
pocket.</p>

<p>"Not with me, anyway," replied Bart with a
smile. "There is something wrong at Cardysville,
a hundred miles or so down the main line,"
he went on.</p>

<p>"And how does that interest you, Bart?"</p>

<p>"Why, it seems I have got to go down there
on some business for the Company."</p>

<p>"To-day?"</p>

<p>"The sooner the better, that letter says. It
is from the inspector. It is quite flattering to
me, for he starts out with complimenting the
excellent business system this office has always
sustained."</p>

<p>"H'm!" chuckled Darry&mdash;"any mention of
your valued extra help?"</p>

<p>"No, but that may come along, for you have
got to represent me here again to-day, and possibly
to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Is that so?" said Darry. "Well, I guess I
can arrange."</p>

<p>"You see," explained Bart, "the letter is a sort
of confidential one. Reading between the lines,
I assume that a certain Peter Pope, now express
agent at Cardysville, and evidently recently appointed,
is a relative of one of the officials of the
company. Anyway, he has been running&mdash;or
not running&mdash;things for a week. The inspector
writes that the man has very little to do, for it is
a small station, but that very little he appears to
do very badly."</p>

<p>"How, Bart?"</p>

<p>"His reports and returns are all mixed up.
He doesn't have the least idea of how to run
things intelligently. The inspector asks me to go
and see him, take some of our blanks, open a set
of books for him, and try and install a system that
will bring things around clearer."</p>

<p>"Why, Bart," exclaimed Darry, "they have
promoted you!"</p>

<p>"I don't see it, Darry."</p>

<p>"That's traveling auditor's work. Besides, a
delicate and confidential mission for an official.
Wake up! you've struck a higher rung on the
ladder, and I'll wager they'll boost you fast."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Darry, I happen to be handy and
accommodating, and they don't want to turn the
fellow down on account of his 'pull.' Maybe they
think the offer and suggestions of a boy will have
a result where a regular official visit would offend
Mr. Peter Pope's backer&mdash;see?"</p>

<p>All the same, Bart felt very much pleased over
this unexpected communication. He blessed his
lucky stars that he had such a bright and dependable
substitute at hand as Darry Haven.</p>

<p>The latter soon made his school and home arrangements,
and Bart left affairs in his hands
about ten o'clock, catching the train west after
getting a pass for the Cardysville round trip.</p>

<p>It was two o'clock when the train arrived at
Bart's destination. He found Cardysville to be
a place of about 2,000 inhabitants. Most of the
town, however, lay half-a-mile away from the
B. &lt; M. Railroad, another line cutting in farther
north.</p>

<p>Bart noticed crowds of people and a circus tent
in the distance. The express shed was a gloomy
little den of a place on a spur track. Near the
depot was a small lunch counter. Bart got something
to eat, and strolled down the tracks.</p>

<p>As he drew near to the express shed, Bart noticed
an old armchair out on its platform.</p>

<p>A very stout man in his shirt sleeves sat in this,
smoking a pipe.</p>

<p>He got up and waddled around restlessly.
Bart noticed that he approached the door of the
express office on tiptoe. He acted scared, for,
bending his ear to listen, he retreated precipitately.
Then he stood stock-still, staring stupidly at the
building.</p>

<p>He gave a nervous start as Bart came up behind
him&mdash;quite a jump, in fact. Bart, studying
his flabby, uneasy face, wondered what was the
matter with the man.</p>

<p>"Hello!" jerked out the Cardysville express
agent. "Sort of startled me."</p>

<p>"Are you Mr. Pope?" inquired Bart.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's me," assented the other. "Stranger
here? looking for me?"</p>

<p>"I am," answered Bart. "My name is Stirling.
I work at the express office at Pleasantville."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I've heard of you," said Peter Pope.
"The express inspector wrote me about you.
He said you was a young kid, sort of green in
the business, who might drop in on me to get
some points on the business."</p>

<p>"Quite so," nodded Bart with a side smile,
"catching on," as the phrase goes, and at once
falling in with the way the inspector was working
matters. "We can't learn too much about the
express business, you know, and I thought that
by comparing notes with you we might dig out
something of mutual benefit."</p>

<p>"You bet!" responded Pope, perking up quite
grandly. "The Vice-President of the express
company is my cousin. I've got a big pull.
Soon as I get the ropes learned, I'm going for a
manager's job in the city."</p>

<p>"That will be quite fine," said Bart. "I
brought some books and blanks with me, and, if
you can spare the time, I would like to have you
see how our system strikes you."</p>

<p>"Sure. Come in&mdash;no, that is, I'll bring out a
chair. I keep only one record. I've got this
business simplified down to a lead pencil and a
scratch book, see?"</p>

<p>Bart did "see," and knew that the express inspector
had "seen," also. He wondered why
Pope did not take him into the office. He marveled
still more as, watching Pope, he noticed
he hesitated at the door of the express shed.
Then Pope moved forward as if actually unwilling
to enter the place.</p>

<p>Half a minute after he had disappeared within
the shed, Pope came rushing out, pale and
flustered. He tumbled over the chair he was
bringing to Bart, and a book he carried went
flying from under his arm into the dirt of the
road beyond the platform.</p>

<p>"Why," exclaimed Bart, in some surprise,
"what is the matter, Mr. Pope?"</p>

<p>"Matter!" gasped Pope, his eyes rolling, as
he backed away from the doorway, "say, that
place is haunted!"</p>

<p>"What place?"</p>

<p>"The express room. I've been worried for an
hour. It's nigh tuckered me out."</p>

<p>"What has?" inquired Bart</p>

<p>"Groans, hisses, rustlings. I thought a while
back that someone was hiding in among the
express stuff, and trying to scare me. 'Taint so,
though. I went among it, and there's no place
for anybody to hide."</p>

<p>"Oh, pshaw!" said Bart reassuringly, "you
are only nervous, Mr. Pope. It's some live
freight, likely. Can I take a look?"</p>

<p>"Sure&mdash;wish you would. I've been posting
up on express business, you see, maybe that's the
matter. Read about fellows hiding in boxes, and
jumping out and murdering the messenger. Read
about enemies sending a man exploding bombs,
and blowing him to pieces."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Mr. Pope!" said Bart, "you
don't look as if you had an enemy in the world."</p>

<p>"I haven't," declared Peter Pope, "but every
business man has his rivals, of course. I've heard
that those city chaps have an eye on any fellow
that makes a record like I'm making here. They
don't want to see him get ahead. They must
guess that I'm in line for a big promotion, and
that might worry them into playing some tragical
trick on me."</p>

<p>Bart wanted to laugh outright. He kept a
straight face, and solemnly started to investigate
the trouble. He stepped into the express room
and took a keen look around, Pope timorously
following him.</p>

<p>"There!" panted Pope suddenly, "what did
I tell you?"</p>

<p>"That's so," said Bart. "It is sort of mysterious.
Someone groaned, sure. What have
you here, anyway?"</p>

<p>Bart went over to a heap of express matter,
come in just that morning. There were several
small crates, a box or two, and a very large trunk.
Bart centered his attention on this latter. He
stooped down as his quick eye observed a row of
holes at one end, just under the hauling strap.</p>

<p>"Quiet, for a minute," he whispered warningly
to Pope, who, big-eyed and trembling, resembled
a man on the threshold of some most appalling
discovery.</p>

<p>Bart's strained hearing shortly caught a rustling
sound. It was followed by a kind of choking
moan. Unmistakably, he decided, both came
from the trunk.</p>

<p>"Is it locked? No," he said, examining the
front of the trunk. Then Bart snapped back its
two catches. He seized the cover and threw it
back.</p>

<p>"Gracious!" gasped Peter Pope.</p>

<p>Bart himself was a trifle startled.</p>

<p>As the trunk cover lifted, a man stepped out.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<h3>ON THE MIDNIGHT EXPRESS</h3>


<p>"Air&mdash;and water!" panted the mysterious
occupant of the trunk.</p>

<p>Bart looked him over in some wonder. He
was a short, wiry man, and arrayed in a close-fitting
costume resembling that of the circus athlete on
duty.</p>

<p>The man was drenched with perspiration and
so nearly exhausted with his suffocating imprisonment,
that his voice was rasping and hollow.</p>

<p>He was weak, too. As he stepped over the
side of the trunk he staggered feebly. Then,
making out an open window and a pail of drinking
water on a bench near it, he made a swift dive
in that direction.</p>

<p>First the man stuck his head out of the
window and drew in great draughts of pure,
fresh air.</p>

<p>Then he seized the tin cup near the pail. He
dipped up the water and drank cupful after cupful
until Bart eyed him in some alarm.</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;h!" breathed the man in a long aspiration
of relief and enjoyment, "that's better. Say,
ten minutes more and there would have been no
Professor Rigoletto."</p>

<p>As he spoke he went back to the trunk. He
took out a long gossamer rain coat that had been
used as a pillow. This he proceeded to put on.</p>

<p>It came to his feet. He buttoned it up, drew
a jaunty crush cap from one of its pockets, and
grinned pleasantly into the face of the petrified
Peter Pope.</p>

<p>"See here!" blurted out the Cardysville express
agent, "this isn't&mdash;isn't regular. It isn't schedule,
you know."</p>

<p>"I hope not&mdash;sincerely," airily retorted the
stranger. "Fifty miles on a slow train, three
hours waiting in a close trunk. Ah, no. But
I've arrived. Ha, ha, that's so!"</p>

<p>He glanced into the trunk. Its bottom seemed
covered with some coarse burlap. Professor
Rigoletto threw shut the cover.</p>

<p>"Aha!" he said suddenly, bending his ear as
a strain of distant circus music floated on the air.
"Show on, I'll be late. I'll call later&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, you don't!" interrupted Pope, recovering
from his fright, and placing his bulky form in
the doorway.</p>

<p>"Don't what, my friend?" mildly asked the
Professor.</p>

<p>"Deadhead&mdash;beat the express company.
You're one trunk&mdash;and excess weight."</p>

<p>"I don't dispute it. What, then?"</p>

<p>"Pay," promptly and definitely announced the
agent.</p>

<p>"Can't. Haven't a cent. That's why I had
to get a friend to ship me this way. But he said
he'd wire ahead to my partner with the circus,
who would call for me here. I'll go and find
him, and settle the bill."</p>

<p>"You don't leave here until those charges are
paid. You want to be rapid, too," declared Pope,
"or I'll see if the railroad company don't want to
collect fare, as well."</p>

<p>"Want to keep me here, eh?" murmured
the Professor thoughtfully. "Well, I'm agreeable,
only you'll have to feed and bed me. If
I'm live stock, I demand live-stock privileges,
see?"</p>

<p>The express agent looked worried.</p>

<p>"What am I to do?" he asked, in a quandary,
of Bart.</p>

<p>"Oh," smiled Bart, "I guess you had better
trust him to find his friend and come back with
the money."</p>

<p>"I'll hold the trunk, anyway," observed Pope.
"What have you got in it? Some old worthless
togs, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Mistake&mdash;about a thousand dollars in value,"
coolly retorted the Professor.</p>

<p>"Yes, you have! I thought so. Some old
burlap."</p>

<p>"Careful, my friend!" spoke the deadhead
sharply. "There's nothing there that you will
care to see."</p>

<p>"Isn't there? I'll investigate, just the same,"
declared Pope, throwing back the trunk cover
and delving in the heap of burlap. "Murder!
Help!"</p>

<p>Peter Pope uttered a fearful yell. He backed
from the trunk suddenly, A sinuous, hissing
form had risen up before his face.</p>

<p>This was an enormous cobra, and, under the
circumstances, very frightful to see. The Cardysville
express agent made a headlong bolt for the
door. He slid clear outside across the platform,
and landed in the mud of the road.</p>

<p>"Prt! prt! Caesar, so&mdash;so!" spoke Professor
Rigoletto in a peculiar, purring tone, approaching
the serpent.</p>

<p>He coaxed and forced the big snake back into
its warm coverings, and shut down the trunk
cover and clasped it. Bart, highly edified at the
unique incident, followed him outside.</p>

<p>"I'm the Cingalese snake-charmer," explained
Professor Rigoletto. "Sorry, my friend," he
observed to the wry-faced Pope, who was busy
scraping the mud from his clothing, "but I told
you so."</p>

<p>"Ugh!" shuddered the agent. "You get that
trunk out of here double-quick, or I'll have you
arrested."</p>

<p>"Sure, I will," answered the Professor with
alacrity, "and I promise you that I will bring or
send you the express charges by the time the
show is over."</p>

<p>Professor Rigoletto dragged the trunk to the
platform. It was not a heavy burden, now.
Bart good-humoredly assisted him in getting
it balanced properly on his shoulder. The professor
courteously thanked him and asked him to
come and see the show free, and marched off
quite contented with the result of his daring deadhead
experiment.</p>

<p>The Cardysville express agent was greatly
worked up over the incident of the hour. It was
some time before he could get his mind sufficiently
calmed down to discuss business affairs
coherently.</p>

<p>Bart, however, handled the man in a pleasant,
politic manner, and soon had results working.</p>

<p>He let Peter Pope imagine that he was the
originator of every idea that he, Bart himself,
suggested. He very deftly introduced the system
in vogue at the Pleasantville express office.</p>

<p>In fact, at the end of two hours Bart had accomplished
all he had been sent to do. He had
got Pope's records into sensible shape, had opened
a small set of books for him, and knew that the
inspector must be pleased with the results.</p>

<p>Bart had missed the early afternoon train.
There was no other running to Pleasantville direct
until eleven o'clock that night.</p>

<p>He had planned to put in the time strolling
about town, when Professor Rigoletto appeared.
He was accompanied by a friend.</p>

<p>The latter ascertained the express charges on
the trunk, paid them, and handed both Bart and
Pope a free ticket to the evening's entertainment.</p>

<p>Bart took a stroll by himself, got his supper at
a neat little restaurant, and met Pope as agreed at
the door of the main show tent at seven o'clock.</p>

<p>They were given good seats, and they had the
pleasure of seeing Professor Rigoletto and his big
snake under more agreeable conditions than those
of their first introduction to them.</p>

<p>The show was a very good one, and at half-past
ten they left the tent. The Cardysville express
agent accompanied Bart to the depot, where the
east bound train was due to arrive in thirty minutes.</p>

<p>As they walked up and down the platform, a
horse and wagon drove up to the little express
shed. Pope went over to it. Bart accompanied
him.</p>

<p>The driver of the wagon was a brisk, smart-looking
farmery individual. Pope knew him, and
nodded to him in a friendly fashion.</p>

<p>"Come after something?" inquired the agent
"I don't recall that there is anything here for
you."</p>

<p>"No, I want to express these hives," answered
the farmer.</p>

<p>He indicated six boxes lying in his wagon, covered
with gauze.</p>

<p>"Bother!" said Pope, a little crossly. "That's
no midnight job. Why don't you come in the
daytime, Mr. Simms? You just caught me here
by chance, at this outlandish hour."</p>

<p>"Particular shipment," explained Simms, "and
I've got to catch the trains just right. You see,
these are special imported Italian bees, Breeders.
I reckon every one of those beauties is worth
half-a-dollar. They're very delicate in this climate,
and call for great care. I want you to instruct
the messenger to follow the directions
carded on the boxes."</p>

<p>"I can do that," said Pope. "What he will
do, is another thing."</p>

<p>"You see," continued the farmer, "if they handle
them carefully at Pleasantville, and see that
they catch the early express to the city from there,
someone will be waiting to take them in charge
at the terminus. I'd be awful glad to tip the
messenger handsomely to have someone at Pleasantville,
where they transfer the hives, open the
ventilators for a spell and tip down into the pans
some of the honey syrup."</p>

<p>"I will do that for you, sir," spoke up Bart&mdash;"I
am in charge of the express office at Pleasantville.
I am going on this train, and I will be
glad to see that your goods are attended to just
right, and transferred on time."</p>

<p>"Say, will you?" exclaimed the farmer in a
pleased tone. "Now, that's just the ticket!
The wrong draught on those bees, or too much
bad air, or too little feed, and they die off in dozens.
You see, at fifty cents apiece, that means
quite a loss on an unlucky shipment."</p>

<p>"It does, indeed, Mr. Simms," responded Bart
"I am very much interested in the little workers,
and you can rest easy as to their being rightly
cared for. I believe I will ride to Pleasantville in
the express car, so your bees will be right under
my eye till they are put on the city express."</p>

<p>"Thank you, thank you," said the farmer
heartily.</p>

<p>As the train whistled in the distance, he came
up to Bart and slipped a bank note in his hand.</p>

<p>Bart demurred, but it was no use. He found
himself two dollars richer for his accommodating
proposition.</p>

<p>As the train drew up, Peter Pope rapped at the
door of the express car. A sleepy-eyed messenger
opened it. The hives were shoved in. Bart
made a brief explanation to the messenger, showing
his pass. He waved a pleasant adieu to Pope
and the farmer as the express car door was closed
and locked.</p>

<p>When Bart got home he was more than tired
out. But he had done well and in the end got
full praise for his work.</p>

<p>A day passed, and Bart failed to find Baker.
He hunted everywhere and kept up the search
until he knew not where to look further.</p>

<p>Bart went home. He had scarcely reached
his bedroom when there was a vigorous summons
at the front door.</p>

<p>"I hope it is Baker," murmured Bart, as he
slipped on the coat he had just taken off.</p>

<p>"A telegram, Bart," said his mother, at the
bottom of the stairs.</p>

<p>She had receipted for it. Bart tore it open
wonderingly, glancing first at the signature, and
marveling at its unusual length. It was signed by
Robert Leslie, superintendent of the express
company, at the city end of the line.</p>

<p>This is what it said:</p>

<p>"Special II. 256 by afternoon express, for
Martin &amp; Company, Pleasantville, contains fifteen
thousand dollars in cash, sender Dunn &amp;
Son, Importers. They ask me to make a special
delivery, and will defray any extra cost for having
it accepted personally by A.B. Martin, and receipted
for by him in the presence of witnesses.
Delivery to be legal, must be made before twelve,
midnight, and this certified to. This is a very
important matter for one of the company's largest
customers. Be sure to make delivery on time."</p>

<p>Bart read the telegram over twice, taking in its
important details, with a serious face.</p>

<p>"Fifteen thousand dollars!" he repeated.
"It has saved me some worry that I did not discover
the amount before. As to the delivery,
that is easy. I've got over two hours yet. I
see what it is. Martin &amp; Company probably
want to throw up a contract because prices have
gone up, the contract must be made binding by
payment of fifteen thousand dollars by midnight,
or Dunn &amp; Son lose. All right."</p>

<p>His mother noticed that some important business
was on her son's mind, and only told Bart
to take care of himself.</p>

<p>Bart hurried towards the express office. At
a street crossing he paused, to let pass a close
carriage that was driven along at a furious rate of
speed in the direction from which he had just
come.</p>

<p>"Hello!" he forcibly ejaculated, as it flashed
by him, the corner street lamp irradiating its interior
brightly&mdash;"there's queer company for
you!"</p>

<p>The remark was warranted. The occupants of
the vehicle were Colonel Jeptha Harrington and
Lem Wacker.</p>

<h3>LATE VISITORS</h3>


<p>The little express office was dark and lonely-looking
when Bart again reached it.</p>

<p>Bart unlocked the office door, shot the
inside bolt carefully after him, lighted the lantern,
placed it on the desk, and opened the
safe.</p>

<p>As he selected the big brown envelope marked
"Martin &amp; Company," and bearing the express
company's shining green seals, his fingers tingled.
The immensity of the sum intrusted to his charge
perturbed him a trifle.</p>

<p>Bart relocked the safe, stowed the envelope in
an inner pocket, and opened the drawer of a little
stand leaning against the safe.</p>

<p>He took out a revolver. Mr. Leslie himself
had advised him to always have one handy in the
express office. Bart had never touched the weapon
before. It had been loaned him by Mr. Haven,
and Darry had brought it to the office. Bart
slipped it now into a side pocket.</p>

<p>He noticed in detail the entry on the messenger's
slip. The prepaid charges on the Martin
&amp; Company consignment were seven dollars and
seventy-five cents, or five cents for every hundred
dollars or fraction of it over the first fifty dollars,
which was charged for at regular tariff rates,
twenty-five cents.</p>

<p>"It is fifteen thousand dollars, right enough!"
mused Bart. "Now, to make sure of the form
of receipt."</p>

<p>He filled out a special receipt that acknowledged
besides the usual delivery, a verification of the
amount of the inclosure, its acceptance as correct,
and left a blank for the names of two witnesses.</p>

<p>Bart was now ready to sally forth on his peculiar
errand, and had fully decided in his mind the
persons he would get to act as his witnesses.</p>

<p>"What is that!" he questioned, suddenly and
sharply.</p>

<p>He could hear a springy vehicle bound over
the near tracks, and then its wheels cut the loose
cindered road leading up to the express office.</p>

<p>It halted. He could catch the quick, labored
breathing of two horses, a carriage door creaked!
some low voices made a brief hum of conversation,
and the vehicle seemed to depart.</p>

<p>Bart stood stock-still, wondering and guessing.
Footsteps sounded on the platform. There came
a thundering thump as of a heavy cane on the
office door.</p>

<p>"Who is there?" demanded Bart.</p>

<p>"Colonel Harrington.  I've got to see you."</p>

<p>"Come in," Bart said, unbolting the door.</p>

<p>Colonel Harrington was red of face and fussy
of manner. He threw the door shut with his foot,
and sank to a bench, breathing heavily.</p>

<p>"Was there something you wanted to say to
me, Colonel Harrington?" inquired Bart.</p>

<p>"Yes there was!" snapped out the rich man of
Pleasantville. "Anxious to see you! Just drove
up to your house. They told me you were here.
I once offered you a hundred dollars."</p>

<p>Bart nodded, with a faint smile.</p>

<p>"It wasn't enough," stumbled on the colonel.
"I am now going to make it a thousand."</p>

<p>"Why, what for, Colonel Harrington?" demanded
Bart in surprise.</p>

<p>"Because you can earn it."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Shall I be blunt and plain?"</p>

<p>"It is always the best way."</p>

<p>"Very well, then," resumed the colonel desperately.
"A certain unclaimed express package
was sold here to-day, marked A.A. Adams.
You've got it."</p>

<p>"How do you know that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you know it and I want it. Hand it
over, and here"&mdash;the colonel made a dive for his
pocketbook&mdash;"here's your thousand dollars."</p>

<p>Bart made a signal of remonstrance with his
hand, his face grave and decided.</p>

<p>"Stop right there, Colonel Harrington," he said
forcibly. "Are you aware that you are offering a
bribe to a bonded representative of the express
company?"</p>

<p>"Rot take your express company!" growled
the colonel angrily. "I am one of its stock-holders.
I could buy the whole concern out,
if I wanted to!"</p>

<p>"Until you do, I obey official instructions,"
announced Bart. "Please do not degrade yourself
and embarrass me, Colonel Harrington, by
saying anything further on this score. I will not
sell my honor, nor swerve a hair's breadth from
a line of duty plain and clear. The package you
refer to was legally purchased by the highest bidder,
I hold it temporarily in trust for him. It is
as safe and sacred with me as if it was the property
of the First National Bank of Pleasantville."</p>

<p>Colonel Harrington squirmed, got red and pale
by turns, gripped his cane fiercely, and then, relaxed
with a groan.</p>

<p>"It's my property!" he declared. "I can
prove it's my property."</p>

<p>"Then I suggest that you persuade the person
who bought it of that fact," said Bart.</p>

<p>"Say!" shot out the colonel eagerly, his eye
brightening, "if I bring an order from that same
person, will you give up the package?"</p>

<p>Bart hesitated.</p>

<p>"You know where he is, then?" he inquired
suspiciously.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I might find him," stammered the military
man.</p>

<p>"I do not think I would," said Bart. "Bring
him here personally, and I will hand it over to
him&mdash;in your presence, if he says so."</p>

<p>The colonel groaned again. It was plainly
to be seen that he was in an intense inward
frenzy.</p>

<p>"Stirling, you've got to give me that package!"
he cried, springing to his feet and lifting his cane
threateningly.</p>

<p>"Have I?" said Bart, facing him watchingly.</p>

<p>"Be careful, Colonel Harrington! you are pretty
near committing a criminal offense."</p>

<p>"You're in the plot&mdash;you know all about it!
Give up that package, or&mdash;or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Colonel Harrington," said Bart calmly, but
every word ringing out as clear as the tone of a
bell, "I am no ruffian, and I hate violence, but if
you lift that cane to me again&mdash;I'll shoot."</p>

<p>Bart showed the gleaming top of the weapon
in his pocket, backing to the door.</p>

<p>Just then the door behind him was forcibly
thrust open, its edge hitting him violently. Then
someone pounced upon him.</p>

<p>The attack was sudden and effective. A piece
of rope was looped deftly about Bart's arms, holding
him helpless, secured behind, and as he was
pushed roughly against the desk. Lem Wacker's
evil face leered down upon him.</p>

<p>"Don't you holler!" ordered Lem.</p>

<p>As he spoke, he leaned over the railing. The
waste box held a mass of cotton that had packed
some of the parcels disposed of at the sale that
afternoon. Lem grabbed up a handful, and forcibly
stuffed it into Bart's mouth.</p>

<p>"Wacker! Wacker!" gasped Colonel Harrington
in affright, "don't&mdash;don't hurt him. This is
dreadful&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shut up!" ordered Lem Wacker recklessly,
"you want something and don't know how to get
it. I do&mdash;and will."</p>

<p>He snatched at Bart's tightly-buttoned coat
and tore it loose, groped inside and drew out a
package.</p>

<p>"I've got it," he announced. "No!&mdash;he
ripped off the end of the parcel&mdash;here's a haul."</p>

<p>Bart writhed, choked on the loose strangling
filaments of cotton, but could not utter a word.</p>

<p>"Give me that package!" cried the colonel.
"Stop! where are you going?"</p>

<p>Lem Wacker had bolted. The colonel stared
in marveling astonishment as his cohort sprang
through the open doorway. Bart had managed
to wad the cotton in his mouth into a compact
wet mass, enabling him to speak.</p>

<p>"Colonel Harrington!" he cried, "that man has
not got the package you were after. He has instead
stolen a money envelope for Martin &amp; Company
containing fifteen thousand dollars in currency,
and is making off with it. Cut this rope
instantly that I may pursue him, or I give you
my word that, as a partner in his crime, rich as
you are, and influential as you are, you shall go
to the State penitentiary."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>

<h3>THIRTY SECONDS OF TWELVE</h3>


<p>It was an exciting moment. Bart was intently
worked up, but he kept his head level. Everything
hung on the action of the next two minutes.</p>

<p>Whatever price the rich Colonel Harrington
was paying Lem Wacker for his co&ouml;peration, it
was not enough to blind that individual to a realization
of the fact that accident had placed in
Wacker's grasp the great haul of his life, and he
was making off with this fortune, leaving the colonel
in the lurch.</p>

<p>The latter stood shaking like an aspen, his
face the color of chalk. Apparently he took
in and believed every word that Bart had spoken.</p>

<p>"I'm in a fix&mdash;a terrible fix!" he groaned.
"This is dreadful&mdash;dreadful!"</p>

<p>"Mend it, then!" cried Bart. "Quick! if you
have one spark of sense or manhood in you.
There's a knife&mdash;cut this rope."</p>

<p>With quivering fingers Colonel Harrington
took up from the desk the office knife used
for cutting string. It was keen-bladed as a razor.
Unsteady and bungling as was his stroke, he
severed the rope partly, and Bart burst his bonds
free.</p>

<p>"Stay here," called out the young express
agent sharply. "I hold you responsible for this
office till I return!"</p>

<p>He dashed outside like a rocket, scanned the
whole roadway expanse, and darted for the freight
yards with the speed of the wind.</p>

<p>The electric arc lights were sparsely scattered,
but there was sufficient illumination for him to
make out a fugitive figure just crossing the
broad roadway towards the freight tracks.</p>

<p>It was Lem Wacker. A train of empty box
freights blocked his way. He stooped, made a
diving scurry under one of them, and was lost to
view.</p>

<p>Bart ran as he had never run before. The
train cleared the tracks as he reached the spot
where Wacker had disappeared.</p>

<p>At that moment above the jangling, clumping
activity of the yards there arose on the night air
one frightful, piercing shriek.</p>

<p>Bart halted with a nameless shock, for the utterance
was distinctly human and curdling. He
glanced after the receding train, fancying that
Wacker might have got caught under the cars
and was being dragged along with them.</p>

<p>That roadbed was clear, however. Two hundred
feet to the right was a second train. Its
forward section was moving off, having just thrown
some cars against others stationary on a siding.</p>

<p>Bart ran towards these. Wacker could not
have so suddenly disappeared in any other direction.
He crossed between bumpers, and glanced
eagerly all around. There was no hiding-place
nearer than the repair shops, and they were five
hundred feet distant.</p>

<p>Wacker could not possibly have reached their
precincts in the limited space of time afforded
since Bart had last lost sight of him.</p>

<p>"He is hiding in some of those cars," decided
Bart, "or he has swung onto the bumpers of the
section pulling out&mdash;hark!"</p>

<p>Bart pricked up his ears. A strange sound
floated on the air&mdash;a low, even, musical tinkle.</p>

<p>Its source could not be far distant. Bart ran
along the side of the stationary freights.</p>

<p>"It is Wacker, sure," he breathed, "for that
is the same sound made by the little alarm clock he
bought at the sale this afternoon."</p>

<p>The last vibrating tintinnabulations of the clock
died away as Bart discovered his enemy.</p>

<p>Lem Wacker's burly figure and white face
were discernible against the direct flare of an arc
light. He seemed a part of the bumpers of two
cars. Bart flared a match once, and uttered the
single word:</p>

<p>"Caught."</p>

<p>Lem Wacker was clinging to the upright brake
rod, and swaying there. His face was bloodless
and he was writhing with pain. One foot
was clamped tight, a crushed, jellied mass between
two bumpers.</p>

<p>It seemed that his foot must have slipped just
as the forward freights were switched down. This
had caused that frenzied yell. Perhaps the
thought of the money had impelled him not
to repeat it, but the little alarm clock which he
carried in his pocket had betrayed him.</p>

<p>Bart took in the situation at a glance. He was
shocked and unnerved, but he stepped close
to the writhing culprit.</p>

<p>"Lem Wacker," he said, "where is that money
envelope?"</p>

<p>"In my pocket," groaned Wacker. "I've
got it this time&mdash;crippled for life!"</p>

<p>The young express agent did not have to
search for the stolen money package. It protruded
from Wacker's side pocket. As he
glanced it over, he saw that it was practically intact.
Wacker had torn open only one corner,
sufficient to observe its contents. Bart placed
the envelope in his own pocket.</p>

<p>"I'm fainting!" declared Wacker.</p>

<p>Bart crossed under the bumpers to the other
side of the freights. He swept the scene with a
searching glance, finally detected the shifting
glow of a night watchman's lantern, and ran over
to its source.</p>

<p>He knew the watchman, and asked the man
to accompany him, explaining as they went along
that Lem Wacker had got caught between two
freights, was held a prisoner in the bumpers with
his foot crushed, and pointed the sufferer out as
they neared the freights.</p>

<p>Wacker by this time had sunk flat on the
bumpers, his limbs twisted up under him, but he
managed to hold on to the brake rod. He only
moaned and writhed when the horrified watchman
spoke to him.</p>

<p>"I'll have to get help," said the latter. "They
will have to switch off the front freights to get
him loose."</p>

<p>The watchman took out his whistle and blew
a kind of a call on the telegraphic system. Two
minutes later Bart saw McCarthy hurriedly rounding
a corner of the freight depot, and advanced
towards him.</p>

<p>The young express agent briefly and confidentially
imparted to his old friend the fact that Lem
Wacker had tried to steal some money from the
express office, and had got his deserts at last.</p>

<p>"Get him clear of the bumpers," said Bart,
"carry him to the express office, call for a surgeon,
and don't let him be taken away from
there till I show up."</p>

<p>"What's moving, Stirling?" inquired McCarthy.</p>

<p>"Something very important. Wacker seems to
be punished enough already, and I do not know
that I want him placed under arrest, but he knows
something he must tell me before he gets out of
my reach."</p>

<p>"Then you had better wait."</p>

<p>"I can't do that," said Bart. "I have a special
to deliver, on personal orders from Mr. Leslie,
the express superintendent."</p>

<p>Bart consulted his watch. It was five minutes
of eleven.</p>

<p>"Only a little over an hour," he reflected.
"I want to hustle!"</p>

<p>He saw to it that the recovered package was
safely stowed in an inner pocket, and started by
the shortest cut he knew from the yards.</p>

<p>Bart did not even pause at the express office,
where he had left Colonel Harrington. He ran
all the way half across the silent, sleeping town,
and never halted until he reached the Haven homestead.</p>

<p>He did not go to the front door, but, well acquainted
with the disposition of the household,
paused under a rear window, picked up a handful
of gravel, threw it against the upper panes, and
gave three low but distinct whistling trills.</p>

<p>He could hear a prompt rustling. In less than
forty seconds Darry Haven stuck his head out of
the window.</p>

<p>"Hello!" he hailed, rubbing his eyes.</p>

<p>"Come down, quick," directed Bart. "Bring
Bob, too."</p>

<p>"What's the lark, Bart?"</p>

<p>"No lark at all," answered Bart&mdash;"strictly business.
Don't take a minute. No need disturbing
the folks. You can be back inside of an
hour."</p>

<p>Bob, hatless and without a collar, came sliding
down the lightning rod two minutes later. Darry
landed on the ground almost simultaneously,
simply letting himself drop from the window
sill.</p>

<p>"Two dollars apiece for half an hour's work,"
said Bart, and then told his companions the details
of the special mission in which he required their
services.</p>

<p>"Ginger! but you're nerve and action," commented
the admiring Bob.</p>

<p>"And good to your friends," put in Darry.</p>

<p>They passed the pickle factory. It stood on
the edge of the town, and the residence of the
senior partner of Martin &amp; Company, whose name
had been mentioned in the telegram, was nearly
half a mile further away.</p>

<p>"Eleven thirty-five," announced Bart, a trifle
anxiously. "It does not give us much time. I
hope there's no slip anywhere."</p>

<p>At just fifteen minutes of midnight the strange
trio passed up the graveled walk leading to the
Martin mansion. The front door had a ponderous
old-fashioned knocker, and Bart plied it without
ceremony.</p>

<p>He began to grow nervous as three minutes
passed by, and not the least attention was paid to
his summons.</p>

<p>Suddenly an upper window was thrust up, and
a man's head came into view.</p>

<p>"Who's there?" demanded a gruff, impatient
voice.</p>

<p>"Is this Mr. Martin, Mr. A.B. Martin?"
inquired Bart.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is&mdash;what do you want?"</p>

<p>"I have an express package for you," explained
Bart.</p>

<p>"Oh, you have?" snapped Mr. Martin.
"What the mischief do you mean waking a man
up at midnight on a thing like that! Deliver it
at the factory in the morning."</p>

<p>The speaker, muttering direfully under his
breath, was about to slam down the window.</p>

<p>"Wait one moment, Mr. Martin," called up
Bart sharply. "This is a special delivery, and a
very important matter. I tender you this package
in the presence of these witnesses, and it is a
legal delivery. If you decline to come down and
take it, and I leave it on your doorstep at the call
of the first tramp who happens to come along, I
have done my duty, and the loss is yours&mdash;a matter
of fifteen thousand dollars."</p>

<p>"What! what!" shouted Martin.</p>

<p>"That is the amount."</p>

<p>"From&mdash;Dunn &amp; Son?"</p>

<p>"I guess that's right," said Bart. "Will you
come down and take it?"</p>

<p>Martin did not reply. He disappeared from
the window, but left it open. Bart heard him
muttering to himself.</p>

<p>"Supposing he doesn't come down?" questioned
Bob, in a whisper.</p>

<p>"I think he will," said Bart. "Eleven forty-eight.
Mr. Martin," he called out loudly, "I
can't wait here all night."</p>

<p>"Shut up!" retorted an angry voice&mdash;"I'm
hurrying all I can."</p>

<p>"He isn't!" spoke Darry, in a low tone to
Bart. "He's on to the business, and playing
for time."</p>

<p>"And he's beat us!" breathed Bob&mdash;"hear
there! twelve o'clock. Your delivery is no good,
Bart! It's just struck a new day!"</p>

<p>"S&mdash;sh!" warned Bart, as a clock inside the
house rang out twelve silvery strokes. "The
clock is wrong. We've got five minutes and a
half yet."</p>

<p>In about two minutes a light flashed in the hall,
the front door was unlocked, and Martin appeared,
half-dressed. Bart relievedly put up his watch.
It was just three minutes of twelve.</p>

<p>He instantly placed the express envelope in
Martin's hands, slipping into the vestibule.</p>

<p>"Mr. Martin," he said, "it is necessary for
you to verify the contents of this package. An
accident happened to it, as you see."</p>

<p>Martin tore the envelope clear open, and
glanced over fifteen bills of one thousand dollar
denomination each.</p>

<p>"All right," he said gruffly.</p>

<p>"Will you sign this receipt?" asked Bart politely,
tendering the slip of paper he had prepared
at the office for this especial occasion. "Thank
you," he added, as the pickle man scrawled a penciled
signature at the bottom of the paper.</p>

<p>"I take this money," said Mr. Martin, looking
up with a peculiar expression on his face, "because
it is delivered by you, but I shall return it to
Dunn &amp; Son to-morrow."</p>

<p>"That is your business, Mr. Martin," said Bart
politely.</p>

<p>"It is, and&mdash;something more! I call on you
and your witnesses to notice that the fifteen
thousand dollars was not delivered to me until six
minutes after twelve, too late to make the tender
legal, which makes the contract null and
void."</p>

<p>Mr. Martin, with a triumphant sweep of his
hand, pointed to a big clock at the end of the
long hall.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," said Bart, holding up
his watch, "but I keep official time, and it is exactly
thirty seconds to midnight. Listen!"</p>

<p>And thirty seconds later, from the Pleasantville
court house tower, the town bell rang out
twelve musical strokes.</p>

<h3>BROUGHT TO TIME</h3>


<p>"I'll go!" said Colonel Jeptha Harrington,
magnate of Pleasantville.</p>

<p>"All right," said Bart Stirling, express company
agent.</p>

<p>It was three o'clock in the morning, and the
scene was the little express office where so many
unusual and exciting happenings had transpired
within twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>The colonel's announcement was given in the
tone of a man facing a hard proposition and forced
to accept it&mdash;or something worse.</p>

<p>Bart's reply was calm and off-handed. During
a two hours' siege with the military man he had
never lost his temper or his wits, and had come
off the victor.</p>

<p>When Bart had concluded his very creditable
piece of business with Mr. Martin of the pickle
factory, he had sent Darry and Bob Haven back
to bed, and had forthwith returned to the express
office.</p>

<p>Colonel Harrington, scared-looking and sullen,
was still there. He seemed to have met his
match in the young express agent, and dared not
defy him.</p>

<p>Bart found McCarthy, the night watchman, on
guard outside, who told him that they had got
Lem Wacker clear of the bumpers, had carried
him into the express office, made up a rude litter,
and had sent for a surgeon.</p>

<p>The latter had just concluded his labors as Bart
entered. Lem Wacker lay with his foot bandaged
up, conscious, and in no intense pain, for the surgeon
had given him some deadening medicine.</p>

<p>"He belongs at the hospital," the surgeon advised
Bart. "That foot will have to come off."</p>

<p>"As bad as that!" murmured Bart.</p>

<p>"Yes. I will telephone for the ambulance when
I leave here."</p>

<p>"Very well," acquiesced Bart. "Can I speak
with the patient?"</p>

<p>"If he will speak with you. He's an ugly,
ungrateful mortal!"</p>

<p>Bart went over to the side of the prostrate man.</p>

<p>"Mr. Wacker," he said, "I do not wish to
trouble you in your present condition, but something
has got to be understood before you leave
this place. You go to the hospital as a prisoner
or as a patient, just as you elect."</p>

<p>"Pile it on! pile it on!" growled Wacker.
"You've got the upper hand, and you'll squeeze
me, I suppose. All the same, those who stand
back of me will take care of me or I'll explode
a bomb that will shatter Pleasantville to pieces!"</p>

<p>Colonel Harrington shuddered at this palpable
allusion to himself.</p>

<p>"And I'm going to sue the railroad company
for my smashed foot. What do you want?"</p>

<p>"This, Mr. Wacker," pursued Bart quietly,
"you have to-night committed a crime that means
State's prison for ten years if I make the complaint."</p>

<p>"I'll have a partner in it, all the same!" remarked
Wacker grimly.</p>

<p>The colonel groaned.</p>

<p>"You were after a package that belongs to a
friend of mine," continued Bart. "I want to
know why, and I want to know what you have
done with that person."</p>

<p>"Don't you torture me!" cried Wacker irritably&mdash;"don't
you let him," he blared out to the
quacking magnate. "I won't say a word. Let
Harrington do as he pleases. He's the king bee!
Only, just this, Harrington, you take care of me
or I'll blow the whole business."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," stammered the colonel in a mean,
servile way, approaching the litter, "leave it all
to me, Wacker. Don't raise a row, Stirling," he
pleaded piteously, "don't have him arrested, I'll
foot the bill, I'll square everything. This matter
must be hushed&mdash;yes, yes, hushed up!" hoarsely
groaned the military man. "Oh, its dreadful,
dreadful!"</p>

<p>Bart felt that he had matters in strong control,
spoke a word to McCarthy and, when the ambulance
came, allowed them to take Lem Wacker
to the hospital.</p>

<p>Then he and Colonel Harrington were alone.
The latter was in a pitiable condition of fear and
humiliation.</p>

<p>"See here, Stirling," he said finally, "I'll confess
the truth. I've done wrong. There's a paper
in that package that would mean disgrace for me if
it was made public. I'll own to that, but it's over
a dead and buried business, and it can do no good
to make it public property now. I warn you if it
is, I will shoot myself through the head."</p>

<p>Bart doubted if the colonel had the courage to
carry out his threat, but he temporized with the
great man, got him to make enough admissions
to somewhat clear the situation, and the long discussion
ended with the announcement by Colonel
Harrington that he "would go."</p>

<p>In other words, he confessed that Baker, Bart's
friend and the highest bidder for the mysterious
express package, was a prisoner in his barn.</p>

<p>In some way Lem Wacker had become aware
of Baker's secret, whatever that was, and had
helped the colonel in his efforts to suppress Baker
and secure possession of the package.</p>

<p>Bart was shocked at this exhibition of cold-blooded
villainy on the part of a representative
member of the community, although he had never
had much use for the pompous, domineering old
tyrant, who now led the way through the silent
Streets of Pleasantville as meek as a lamb.</p>

<p>He took Bart through the beautiful grounds of
his sumptuous home, and to a windowless padlocked
room in the loft of the stable.</p>

<p>Poor Baker, his hands secured with stout pieces
of wire, arose from a stool with a gleam of hope on
his pallid face as Bart followed the colonel into
the room.</p>

<p>"See here, Baker&mdash;which isn't your name&mdash;but
it will do&mdash;" said the colonel at once, "things
have turned your way. Your friend here, young
Stirling, has got the whip-hand&mdash;I am cornered,
and admit it. I want to make a proposition
to you, Stirling needn't hear it. When you have
decided, we will call him into the room again and
he will see that you get your rights. Is that
satisfactory?"</p>

<p>"What shall I do?" asked Baker of Bart.</p>

<p>"Hear what Colonel Harrington has to say.
If it suits you, settle up this matter as you think
right. I am here to see that he does as he
promises."</p>

<p>Bart stepped out of the room. There was a
continuous hum of conversation for nearly half an
hour. Then the colonel opened the door.</p>

<p>"I'm to go into the house to write out something
Baker wants," he explained. "Then I'll
come back."</p>

<p>"Very well," nodded Bart.</p>

<p>He tried to engage Baker in conversation, but
the latter, his hands free now, paced the room
nervously, acting like some caged animal.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid of him!" he declared. "I don't
know that I am doing what is best. He's a bad
man. He begs me to spare him for the sake of
his family."</p>

<p>"Is this a matter where settlement will do any
injustice to others?" asked Bart.</p>

<p>"None, now&mdash;it is past that."</p>

<p>"Then follow the dictates of your own judgment,
Mr. Baker," directed Bart, "being sure
that you are acting with a clear conscience."</p>

<p>Colonel Harrington, when he returned, brought
two documents. Baker looked them over.</p>

<p>"Are they satisfactory?" inquired the colonel
anxiously.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Baker.</p>

<p>"Now understand, there is to be no gossip
about this affair?" insisted the magnate.</p>

<p>"I shan't talk," said Baker.</p>

<p>"And I am to have that express package?"</p>

<p>"Give it to him, Stirling."</p>

<p>Bart took the mysterious unclaimed package
from his pocket. Colonel Harrington seized it
with a satisfied cry.</p>

<p>"You have wronged myself and others deeply,
Colonel Harrington," said Baker in a grave,
reproachful tone, "but you have made some
amends. I forgive you, and I hope you will
be a better man."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX"></a>CHAPTER XXX</h2>

<h3>"STILL HIGHER!"</h3>


<p>Bart Stirling was a proud and happy boy as
he stood at the door of the express office looking
down the tracks of the B. &amp; M.</p>

<p>A new spur was being constructed, and it
divided to semi-inclose a substantial foundation
which was the start of the new and commodious
express office. The blue sky, smiling down on
the busy scene, was no more serene than the
prospect which the future seemed to offer for
the successful young express agent.</p>

<p>With his last reckless crime Lem Wacker had
ceased to be a disturbing element at Pleasantville.
After two months' confinement he had limped
out of the hospital, out of town, and out of Bart
Stirling's life.</p>

<p>Colonel Jeptha Harrington himself had left
town with the beginning of winter. It was said
he intended to make an extended trip in Europe.</p>

<p>With his departure, a new Mr. Baker seemed
to spring into existence. Divested of his disguise,
no longer a fear-filled roustabout fugitive,
Bart's strange friend had found a steady, lucrative
position at the hotel, and Bart felt that he
had certainly been the means of doing some real
good in the world every time he looked at the
happy, contented face of his prot&eacute;g&eacute;.</p>

<p>Concerning all the details of Baker's past, Bart
never knew the entire truth.</p>

<p>Baker felt, however, that it was due to his champion
that he explain in the main the mystery of
his connection with Colonel Harrington, and he
told a strange story.</p>

<p>It seemed that the purse-proud colonel had a
poor brother living in another State.</p>

<p>This brother owned a farm on which there lived
with him a man named Adams, a widower, and his
little daughter, Dorothy.</p>

<p>Adams was a close friend of Samuel Harrington,
and out of his earnings saved the place from being
taken on a mortgage.</p>

<p>Samuel Harrington always told Adams that he
had made a will, and that in case of his sudden death
the farm would go to him. He gave Adams a letter
certifying to his having a claim of over three thousand
dollars against the property, which he told
Adams to show to his rich brother when he died,
asserting that, although Colonel Harrington had
shamefully neglected him, he would never dishonorably
repudiate a claim of that kind.</p>

<p>When Samuel Harrington died, his brother appeared,
took possession of the farm as only heir,
and cruelly drove Mr. Adams and his child from
the place.</p>

<p>He tore up the written statement Adams gave
him, ridiculed his claims, and, no will being found,
sold the place for a song and left Adams an invalid
pauper.</p>

<p>Adams had done Baker, or, as his real name
was, Albert Baker Mills, a great service once.</p>

<p>Baker, or Mills, supported Adams and his child
for a year. Adams spent all his time bemoaning
his fate, and haunted the old farm in a search of
the will of Samuel Harrington.</p>

<p>One day he did not appear, nor the following.
Early on the morning of the third day he staggered
into the house, weak and fainting. He was
taken down with a fever, was delirious for a week,
and at the end of that time died.</p>

<p>Just before his death he tried to tell something
about the will. Baker made out that he had found
it, that it was at Pleasantville, nothing more.</p>

<p>After his friend's death, Baker wrote a letter to
Colonel Harrington. He accused him of his dishonorable
conduct, and threatened to publicly expose
him if he did not provide in some way for the
little orphan, Dorothy, for whom he had found a
home with a poor relative.</p>

<p>A week later Colonel Harrington sought
out Baker, told him he had trumped up a
charge against him that would land him in jail,
which Baker later discovered was the truth,
and gave him twenty-four hours to leave the
country.</p>

<p>From that time the poor fellow was a fugitive,
venturing to appear only in disguise at Pleasantville.
Adams, it seemed, had found the will and
had sent it to Pleasantville addressed to himself,
not daring to face the colonel with the important
document in his possession, but never living to
carry out his plan.</p>

<p>In the settlement with Colonel Harrington,
Baker had received a letter exculpating him totally
from the trumped up charge, and a check for five
thousand dollars, which money was now held in
trust by a bank to provide for little Dorothy's
future.</p>

<p>Bart felt much gratified over the way all these
tangled strands in the warp and woof of his young
life had been straightened out, but he experienced
a final blessing that filled him with unutterable joy
and gratefulness.</p>

<p>A week previous his father had returned from
a month's treatment by a city expert oculist.</p>

<p>Robert Stirling came back to Pleasantville a
well man.</p>

<p>That was a joyful night at the little Stirling
home, when Mr. Stirling once again looked with
restored sight upon the faces of the many friends
who respected and loved him.</p>

<p>Mr. Stirling, while in the city, had been an invited
guest at the home of Mr. Leslie, and the
express superintendent had learned a good deal
more about his devoted son than he had ever
known before.</p>

<p>"Come out of it!" hailed a jolly voice, and
Bart was disturbed in his pleasant reverie by the
appearance of Darry and Bob Haven.</p>

<p>"It's settled!" cried the latter ecstatically?&mdash;"we're
going into the regular business at
last."</p>

<p>"I don't quite catch on," returned Bart.</p>

<p>"The printing and publishing business," put in
Darry. "We have got the money together for a
nice little plant, and father and mother are willing
that we shall go ahead. Some day you'll see us
running a regular newspaper."</p>

<p>"Well, I wish you good luck&mdash;you certainly
deserve it," answered the young express agent,
warmly.</p>

<p>"There is only one drawback," resumed Bob.
"We'll have to give up helping you."</p>

<p>"Don't let that bother you. I'll find somebody
else. Say, it will be fine to start a regular
newspaper," went on Bart. "I guess you'd wake
some of the old-timers up&mdash;they are so moss-eaten.
This town needs a bright, up-to-date
sheet."</p>

<p>"We are going to push the printing and publishing
business all we can," answered Darry,
earnestly. How he and his brother carried out
their project I shall relate in another story, to be
called, "Working Hard to Win." It was no light
undertaking, but the boys entered into it with a
vigor that was bound to command success.</p>

<p>"You see, father can help us a good deal," said
Bob. "He used to be an editor, you know. And
more than that, mother can make us whatever pictures
we may need."</p>

<p>"Oh, you'll be right in it, I know," laughed
Bart. "When you start your newspaper put me
down as the first subscriber. Your subscription
money is ready whenever you want it."</p>

<p>At that moment a messenger appeared.</p>

<p>"Letter for you," said he to the young express
agent, and hurried about his business.</p>

<p>"From the express people," murmured Bart,
tearing open the letter.</p>

<p>As he perused it, such a quick, bright glow
flashed into his face and eyes, that the watchful
Darry at once surmised that Bart had received a
communication out of the ordinary.</p>

<p>"Good news, Bart?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Read it," said Bart simply, and quick-witted
Darry saw that he was almost too overcome to
speak further.</p>

<p>The letter was from Mr. Leslie the superintendent,
and contained two paragraphs.</p>

<p>The first stated that from the fifteenth of the
coming month Mr. Robert Stirling would resume
his position as express agent at Pleasantville,
thenceforward made a "Class B" station, at a
salary of seventy dollars a month.</p>

<p>The second paragraph requested Mr. Bart Stirling
to report at headquarters for assignment to
duty at a city office as assistant manager.</p>

<p>Darry Haven reached out and caught the hand
of his loyal friend in a warm, glad clasp.</p>

<p>"Capital!" he cried enthusiastically&mdash;"in line
with your motto, Bart Stirling&mdash;higher still!"</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
